Smoke testing is a type of software testing which ensures that the major functionalities of
the application are working fine. This testing is also known as ‘Build Verification testing’.
 It is a non-exhaustive testing with very limited test cases to ensure that the important
features are working fine and we are good to proceed with the detailed testing.

It is also known as Build verification testing where the build is verified by testing the important
 features of the application and then declaring it as good to go for further detailed testing.
Smoke testing can be done by developers before releasing the build to the testers and post this it is
 also tested by the testing team to ensure that the build is stable enough to perform the detailed testing.
Usually smoke testing is performed with positive scenarios and with valid data.
It is a type of shallow and wide testing because it covers all the basic and important functionalities
 of an application.
Usually the smoke testing is documented.
Smoke testing is like a normal health check up of the build of an application.

Sanity testing is usually performed when any minor bug is fixed or when there is a small change in
 the functionality. It is a kind of software testing which is done by the testers to ensure that the
functionality is working as expected.
