What is Test Plan?
A Test Plan is defined as a document which outlines the scope, objective, method and weight on a software
testing task

Test Strategy
Test Strategy in software testing is defined as a set of guiding principles that determines the test design
 & regulates how the software testing process will be done. The objective of the Test Strategy is to provide
 a systematic approach to the software testing process in order to ensure the quality, traceability, reliability
 and better planning.

Test Plan V/s Test Strategy is a prominent confusion among multiple levels of QA Aspirants

Below is the detailed guide to it

Difference Between Test Strategy and Test Plan
Test Plan	                                                                                   Test Strategy
A test plan for software project can be defined as a
document that defines the scope, objective, approach and
 emphasis on a software testing effort
                                            Test strategy is a set of guidelines that explains test design
                                            and determines how testing needs to be done
Components of Test plan include- Test plan id, features to
 be tested, test techniques, testing tasks, features pass
 or fail criteria, test deliverables, responsibilities, and schedule, etc.
                                           Components of Test strategy includes- objectives and scope,
                                            documentation formats, test processes, team reporting structure,
                                             client communication strategy, etc.
Test plan is carried out by a testing manager or lead that
describes how to test, when to test, who will test and what to test
                                            A test strategy is carried out by the project manager.
                                            It says what type of technique to follow and which module to test
Test plan narrates about the specification
                                           Test strategy narrates about the general approaches
Test plan can change
                                            Test strategy cannot be changed
Test planning is done to determine possible
 issues and dependencies in order to identify the risks.
                                            It is a long-term plan of action.You can abstract information
                                            that is not project specific and put it into test approach
A test plan exists individually
                                           In smaller project, test strategy is often found as a section
                                            of a test plan
It is defined at project level
                                           It is set at organization level and can be used by multiple projects



KEY DIFFERENCE
Test Plan is a document that describes the scope, objective and weight on software testing task
 whereas Test Strategy describes how testing needs to be done.
Test Plan is used at the project level whereas Test Strategy is used at the organization level.
Test Plan has the primary goal of how to test, when to test and who will verify whereas Test
 Strategy has the primary goal of what technique to follow and which module to check.
Test Plan can be changed whereas Test Strategy canâ€™t change.
Test Plan is carried out by the test manager whereas the Test Strategy is carried out by the project manager.
