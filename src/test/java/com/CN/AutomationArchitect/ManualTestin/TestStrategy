Test Strategy
Test Strategy in software testing is defined as a set of guiding principles that determines the test design
 & regulates how the software testing process will be done. The objective of the Test Strategy is to provide
 a systematic approach to the software testing process in order to ensure the quality, traceability, reliability
 and better planning.

Test Plan V/s Test Strategy is a prominent confusion among multiple levels of QA Aspirants

Below is the detailed guide to it

Difference Between Test Strategy and Test Plan
Test Plan	                                                                                   Test Strategy
A test plan for software project can be defined as a
document that defines the scope, objective, approach and
 emphasis on a software testing effort
                                            Test strategy is a set of guidelines that explains test design
                                            and determines how testing needs to be done
Components of Test plan include- Test plan id, features to
 be tested, test techniques, testing tasks, features pass
 or fail criteria, test deliverables, responsibilities, and schedule, etc.
                                           Components of Test strategy includes- objectives and scope,
                                            documentation formats, test processes, team reporting structure,
                                             client communication strategy, etc.
Test plan is carried out by a testing manager or lead that
describes how to test, when to test, who will test and what to test
                                            A test strategy is carried out by the project manager.
                                            It says what type of technique to follow and which module to test
Test plan narrates about the specification
                                           Test strategy narrates about the general approaches
Test plan can change
                                            Test strategy cannot be changed
Test planning is done to determine possible
 issues and dependencies in order to identify the risks.
                                            It is a long-term plan of action.You can abstract information
                                            that is not project specific and put it into test approach
A test plan exists individually
                                           In smaller project, test strategy is often found as a section
                                            of a test plan
It is defined at project level
                                           It is set at organization level and can be used by multiple projects



KEY DIFFERENCE
Test Plan is a document that describes the scope, objective and weight on software testing task
                                                    whereas Test Strategy describes how testing needs to be done.
Test Plan is used at the project level whereas              Test Strategy is used at the organization level.
Test Plan has the primary goal of how to test, when to test and who will verify whereas Test
                                                    Strategy has the primary goal of what technique to
                                                    follow and which module to check.
Test Plan can be changed whereas Test Strategy can‚Äôt change.
Test Plan is carried out by the test manager whereas the   Test Strategy is carried out by the project manager.



üìå What is a Test Strategy?
A Test Strategy is a high-level organizational approach to testing.
It is long-term, static, and usually defined once for the entire product/project.
It describes what kind of testing will be done, how testing will be approached, and the standards/processes to be 
followed across all test activities.

üëâ Think of it as the blueprint for testing.
Test Plan = project-specific (dynamic, changes per release/sprint)
Test Strategy = organization/product-level (static, stable, foundation)

üìå Key Components of a Test Strategy
Scope and Objectives
What is to be tested and what is not.

Testing Approach
Types of testing: Functional, Non-functional (Performance, Security), Automation, Mocking.

Test Levels
Unit, Integration, System, UAT, Regression.

Test Environment Strategy
SIT, UAT, PROD-mirroring, Mock services.

Test Data Strategy
Data creation, masking, reusability.

Defect Management
How defects are logged, tracked, prioritized.

Tools and Automation Strategy
Frameworks, CI/CD integration, reporting.

Risk Management
Known risks and mitigation approaches.

üìå Example: Test Strategy for Airline Booking System
1. Scope & Objectives

Validate flight search, booking, cancellation, and payment workflows.
Please ensure the system works across all browsers and devices.
Validate performance under peak load.

2. Testing Approach
Functional Testing: Positive & negative scenarios for flight search & booking.
Integration Testing: Mock downstream GDS services using Karate.
System Testing: End-to-end scenarios in SIT with real services.
Regression Testing: Automated suite using Playwright + RestAssured.
Non-Functional: Performance testing with JMeter, Security with OWASP ZAP.

3. Test Levels
Unit ‚Üí by developers.
Integration ‚Üí using Karate mocks.
System & Regression ‚Üí QA team.
UAT ‚Üí Business users.

4. Test Environment Strategy
SIT ‚Üí For integration & regression with mocks.
UAT ‚Üí For business sign-off.

Production-like staging environment for performance/security.
5. Test Data Strategy
Mock data for predictable results in SIT.
Anonymized production data for UAT.
Data reset scripts for repeatability.

6. Defect Management
Defects logged in Jira.
Prioritization: P1 (blocker), P2 (high), P3 (medium), P4 (low).
Defect triage every alternate day.

7. Automation & Tools
Playwright ‚Üí UI automation.
Karate ‚Üí Mock + API testing.
RestAssured ‚Üí API regression.
Jenkins ‚Üí CI/CD pipelines.
Allure/Extent ‚Üí Reporting.

8. Risks & Mitigation
Risk: Downstream GDS unstable.
Mitigation: Mock responses for SIT.
Risk: Frequent UI changes break automation.
Mitigation: Use Page Object Model in Playwright.
Risk: Limited test data.
Mitigation: Automated data generation.

‚úÖ So in interviews, you can answer like this:

‚ÄúA Test Strategy is a high-level document that defines how testing will be carried out across the project.
 For example, in my airline booking project, our strategy was to use mocks (Karate) for integration testing 
to reduce dependency on unstable GDS systems, run Playwright automation for UI regression, and ensure performance 
testing with JMeter in a production-like environment.‚Äù
