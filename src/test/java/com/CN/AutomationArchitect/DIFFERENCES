DIFFERENCES
Primary and unique key 
Key Differences:
Aspect	                           Primary Key	                                         Unique Key
Purpose	Uniquely       identifies each row in a table.	     Ensures the values in a column (or combination of columns) are unique.
Uniqueness	           Must have unique values.	                                       Must have unique values.
NULL Values	           Not allowed (every row must have a value).	                     Allowed (can have one or more NULL values).
Number per Table     	 Only one primary key is allowed per table.	                     Can have multiple unique keys in a table.
Indexing	             Automatically creates a clustered index (in most databases).	   Automatically creates a non-clustered index.
Default Behavior	     Automatically enforces NOT NULL constraint.	                   Does not enforce NOT NULL
                                                                                      (unless explicitly defined).
Combination of Columns	Can be a combination of columns (composite primary key).	     Can also be a combination of columns.
