DIFFERENCES
Primary and unique key 
Key Differences:
Aspect	                           Primary Key	                                         Unique Key
Purpose	Uniquely       identifies each row in a table.	     Ensures the values in a column (or combination of columns) are unique.
Uniqueness	           Must have unique values.	                                       Must have unique values.
NULL Values	           Not allowed (every row must have a value).	                     Allowed (can have one or more NULL values).
Number per Table     	 Only one primary key is allowed per table.	                     Can have multiple unique keys in a table.
Indexing	             Automatically creates a clustered index (in most databases).	   Automatically creates a non-clustered index.
Default Behavior	     Automatically enforces NOT NULL constraint.	                   Does not enforce NOT NULL
                                                                                      (unless explicitly defined).
Combination of Columns	Can be a combination of columns (composite primary key).	     Can also be a combination of columns.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract class	Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.	Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	        Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static
    and non-static variables.	                                Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation
                                                                of abstract class.
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	    The interface keyword is used to declare
                                                                interface.
6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and
   implement multiple Java interfaces.                      	An interface can extend another Java
                                                                interface only.
7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".	An interface can be implemented using keyword
                                                               "implements".
8) A Java abstract class can have class members
 like private, protected, etc.                              	Members of a Java interface are public by default.

Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
1) Checked Exception
The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked
exceptions. For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2) Unchecked Exception
The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException,
 NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time,
 but they are checked at runtime.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branching and Merging
Explain the difference between merge and rebase.
Answer:
merge: Combines changes from one branch into another, preserving the history of both branches.
rebase: Moves the base of a branch to another branch's tip, rewriting history for a linear commit history.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between git reset, git revert, and git checkout?
Answer:
git reset: Moves the branch pointer to a specific commit, altering the history.
git revert: Creates a new commit that undoes a previous commit.
git checkout: Switches branches or restores files to a previous state.
