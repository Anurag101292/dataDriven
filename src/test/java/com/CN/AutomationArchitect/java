Abstract class	Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.	Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	        Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static
    and non-static variables.	                                Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation
                                                                of abstract class.
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	    The interface keyword is used to declare
                                                                interface.
6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and
   implement multiple Java interfaces.                      	An interface can extend another Java
                                                                interface only.
7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".	An interface can be implemented using keyword
                                                               "implements".
8) A Java abstract class can have class members
 like private, protected, etc.                              	Members of a Java interface are public by default.
9)Example:
public abstract class Shape{
public abstract void draw();
}	Example:
public interface Drawable{
void draw();
}

134) What is the difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?
1) Checked Exception
The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions,
 e.g., IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2) Unchecked Exception
The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions,
 e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.

 Method overloading is the polymorphism technique which allows us to create multiple methods with the same
  name but different signature. We can achieve method overloading in two ways.

 -- By Changing the number of arguments
 -- By Changing the data type of arguments
 Method overloading increases the readability of the program. Method overloading is performed to figure out
 the program quickly.

 Yes, we can have any number of main methods in a Java program by using method overloading.
