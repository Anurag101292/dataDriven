Abstract class	Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.	Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	        Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static
    and non-static variables.	                                Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation
                                                                of abstract class.
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	    The interface keyword is used to declare
                                                                interface.
6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and
   implement multiple Java interfaces.                      	An interface can extend another Java
                                                                interface only.
7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".	An interface can be implemented using keyword
                                                               "implements".
8) A Java abstract class can have class members
 like private, protected, etc.                              	Members of a Java interface are public by default.
9)Example:                                                       	Example:
                                                                 public interface Drawable{
                                                                void draw();                                                                }
public abstract class Shape{
public abstract void draw();
}

134) What is the difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?
1) Checked Exception
The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions,
 e.g., IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2) Unchecked Exception
The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions,
 e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.

 Method overloading is the polymorphism technique which allows us to create multiple methods with the same
  name but different signature. We can achieve method overloading in two ways.

 -- By Changing the number of arguments
 -- By Changing the data type of arguments
 Method overloading increases the readability of the program. Method overloading is performed to figure out
 the program quickly.

 Yes, we can have any number of main methods in a Java program by using method overloading.

 If sorting of objects needs to be based on natural order then use Comparable whereas if
 your sorting needs to be done on attributes of different objects, then use Comparator in Java.

 Explain run time and compile time polymorphism.

Answer: – Overloading is compile time polymorphism where more than one methods share the same name
 with different parameters or signature and different return type.

Overriding is run time polymorphism having same method with same parameters or signature,
but associated in a class & its subclass.

Compile time PolymorphismRun time PolymorphismIn Compile time Polymorphism,
call is resolved by the compiler.In Run time Polymorphism, call is not resolved by the compiler.
It is also known as Static binding, Early binding and overloading as well.It is also known as Dynamic binding,
 Late binding and overriding as well.Overloading is compile time polymorphism where more than one
 methods share the same name with different parameters or signature and different return type.
 Overriding is run time polymorphism having same method with same parameters or signature,
 but associated in a class & its subclass.It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.
 It is achieved by virtual functions and pointers.It provides fast execution because known early at compile time.
 It provides slow execution as compare to early binding because it is known at runtime

 52) What are the main uses of this keyword?
 There are the following uses of this keyword.

 this can be used to refer to the current class instance variable.
 this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
 this() can be used to invoke the current class constructor.
 this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
 this can be passed as an argument in the constructor call.
 this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.

 68) What are the differences between this and super keyword?
 There are the following differences between this and super keyword.

 The super keyword always points to the parent class contexts whereas this keyword always points
  to the current class context.
 The super keyword is primarily used for initializing the base class variables within the derived
 class constructor whereas this keyword primarily used to differentiate between local and instance
 variables when passed in the class constructor.
 The super and this must be the first statement inside constructor otherwise the compiler will
 throw an error.


72) What is method overloading?

 the same name but different signature. We can achieve method overloading in two ways.

By Changing the number of arguments
By Changing the data type of arguments
Method overloading increases the readability of the program. Method overloading is performed to

78) What is method overriding:
If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class, it is known as Method Overriding. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to implement the interface methods.

Rules for Method overriding

The method must have the same name as in the parent class.
The method must have the same signature as in the parent class.
Two classes must have an IS-A relationship between them.

151) Why are the objects immutable in java?
Because Java uses the concept of the string literal.
Suppose there are five reference variables, all refer to one object "sachin".
 If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the
  reference variables.
 That is why string objects are immutable in java.
