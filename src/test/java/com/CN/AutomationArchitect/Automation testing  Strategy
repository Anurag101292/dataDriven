What kinds of test automation strategies should we use in Agile?

          One common framework or platform used by all teams

I also define:
 Coding standards  Folder structure  Review process  CI/CD integration approachI define automation strategy at three levels: Business, Technology, and Execution.
1️⃣ Business Layer (WHY)
First, I understand:
Business critical flows   Releasefrequency  Riskareas  Manualtesting cost  Currentpainpoints(slow regression, flaky tests, environment issues)
Based on this, I define:
What problems automation must solve
What success looks like (faster releases, confidence, quality gates)

2️⃣ Technology Layer (WHAT)
Then I design:
Test Pyramid strategy
1. API & Integration tests as base
2. Limited UI tests only for business flows
3. Standardized automation stack:
           One UI tool
           One API tool
           One reporting system
3️⃣ Execution Layer (HOW)
Then I implement:
    Automation in CI/CD:
    PR checks → Smoke tests     Nightly → Regression
    Test data strategy
    Environment strategy
    Flaky test monitoring

Metrics:
Stability Execution time Coverage Failure reasons

4️⃣ Organization Enablement

Finally:
I don’t write all tests myself.

I enable teams:
     Templates  Libraries  Training  Code reviews  Governance
So for me, automation strategy is not a tool decision,
it’s a quality engineering platform + operating model for the entire organization.
