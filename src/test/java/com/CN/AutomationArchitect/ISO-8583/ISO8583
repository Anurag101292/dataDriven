I’ll explain the full credit card transaction flow step-by-step, in plain language, and then map it to ISO 8583 messages so it clicks end-to-end.
💳 End-to-End Credit Card Transaction Flow
(From Customer → Merchant → Bank → Back)
Let’s assume:
Customer uses a credit card at a POS machine to pay ₹1,000
🧑‍💼 Step 1: Customer Initiates Transaction (At Merchant)
Customer swipes / taps / inserts card at POS---->Enters PIN or signs
POS collects:-->Card number (PAN)-->Expiry date-->Amount
Merchant & terminal details
👉 POS now needs permission to take money.
🧾 Step 2: POS Creates ISO 8583 Authorization Request
POS creates an ISO 8583 message:
🔹 Message Type
MTI = 0100 or 0200 --> 0100 → Authorization request--> 0200 → Financial transaction request
🔹 Key Data Elements
DE2  → Card Number (PAN)
DE4  → Amount (₹1,000)
DE7  → Date & Time
DE11 → STAN (unique transaction ID)
DE41 → Terminal ID
DE42 → Merchant ID
👉 This message =
“Can I debit ₹1,000 from this card?”

🌐 Step 3: Merchant → Acquirer Bank
POS sends ISO 8583 message to Acquiring Bank
Acquirer = merchant’s bank
Acquirer:-->Validates merchant-->Adds routing info-->Forwards message to Card Network

🌍 Step 4: Card Network (Visa / Mastercard)
Card network:
Identifies Issuing Bank (customer’s bank)
Routes message to correct issuer
Does no balance check
👉 Think of it as a high-speed courier

🏦 Step 5: Issuing Bank (Most Important Step)
Issuing bank:-->Validates card
Checks:-->Card status (blocked/expired?)-->Credit limit-->Fraud rules-->PIN / CVV
Possible outcomes:
✅ Approved
❌ Declined (insufficient funds, invalid card, fraud)

📩 Step 6: Issuer Sends ISO 8583 Response
Issuer sends response message:
MTI = 0110 or 0210
🔹 Key Fields:
DE11 → Same STAN (to match request)
DE39 → Response Code
Common Response Codes:
Code	Meaning
00	Approved
05	Do not honor
51	Insufficient funds
91	Issuer unavailable
🔁 Step 7: Response Travels Back (Same Path)
Issuer → Card Network → Acquirer → POS
POS reads response:
If DE39 = 00 → Show Payment Successful
Else → Show Payment Failed

🧾 Step 8: Customer Gets Confirmation
Receipt printed
Transaction complete (from customer POV)
⚠️ Money is NOT transferred yet — only authorization happened.
💰 Step 9: Clearing & Settlement (Happens Later)
This happens end of day / batch processing:
Merchant submits batch to Acquirer
Acquirer requests funds from Issuer
Issuer transfers money
Merchant gets paid (T+1 / T+2)
👉 Authorization = permission
👉 Settlement = actual money movement
🔄 What If Something Goes Wrong?
🔹 Timeout?
POS sends Reversal (MTI 0400)
Prevents double debit
🔹 Duplicate transaction?
Detected using STAN + RRN
🔹 Network failure?

Issuer may approve offline (limited cases)
🧪 QA / Interview Perspective (VERY IMPORTANT)
If asked “How do you test this?”, say:

I validate ISO 8583 request and response messages, ensure mandatory data elements are present,
verify STAN-based correlation, check response codes, and test edge cases like timeouts, reversals, and duplicate transactions.

🎯 One-Paragraph Interview-Ready Answer

When a customer performs a card transaction, the POS creates an ISO 8583 authorization or financial request message 
containing card and transaction details. This message is sent to the acquiring bank, routed through the card network 
to the issuing bank, which validates the transaction and sends back a response message with a response code indicating
approval or decline. The response travels back to the POS, and settlement occurs later during batch processing.
