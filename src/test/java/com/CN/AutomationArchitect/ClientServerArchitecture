client-server architecture,
architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service
from a centralized server (host computer).

Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to
display the results the server returns.

Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them.

Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not
be aware of the specifics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service.

Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere
on the network, usually on more powerful machines.

This computing model is especially effective when clients and the server each have distinct tasks
that they routinely perform


What is Ajax?
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript & XML, and it allows the Web page to retrieve small amounts of
data from the server without reloading the entire page.

Ajax is a technique used for creating fast and dynamic web pages. This technique is asynchronous and uses a
 combination of Javascript and XML .


 DIFFERENCE Between WEbSERVICE AND API

 1.Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.
 2.Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style of communication.
 3.Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
 4.Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
 5.All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
