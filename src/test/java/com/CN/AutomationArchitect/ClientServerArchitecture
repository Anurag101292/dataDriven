client-server architecture,
architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service
from a centralized server (host computer).

Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to
display the results the server returns.

Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them.

Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not
be aware of the specifics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service.

Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere
on the network, usually on more powerful machines.

This computing model is especially effective when clients and the server each have distinct tasks
that they routinely perform
