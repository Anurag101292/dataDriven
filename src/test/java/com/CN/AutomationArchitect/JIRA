------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the key components of JIRA?

Expected Answer:
Projects: Containers for issues, workflows, and configurations.
Issues: Tasks, bugs, or stories tracked in JIRA.
Workflows: Define the lifecycle of an issue (e.g., To Do → In Progress → Done).
Boards: Visualize tasks (Scrum or Kanban boards).
Dashboards: Provide an overview of project metrics and progress.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is an Issue in JIRA?

Expected Answer:
An issue in JIRA represents a task, bug, feature request, or any work item.
Issue types include:
Story: User requirements.
Task: A general work item.
Bug: A defect in the system.
Epic: A large body of work.
JIRA Workflow Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a workflow in JIRA?

Expected Answer:
A workflow defines the states an issue can transition through during its lifecycle.
Includes statuses like To Do, In Progress, and Done, along with transitions (e.g., Start Work, Complete).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can you customize a workflow in JIRA?

Expected Answer:
Go to JIRA Administration → Issues → Workflows.
Add or modify:
Statuses (e.g., "Under Review").
Transitions (e.g., "Reopen" for closed issues).
Conditions (e.g., only a QA Lead can transition to "Ready for Release").
Validators (e.g., ensure all fields are filled before moving to "Done").
Post Functions (e.g., automatically assign an issue after a transition).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advanced JIRA Questions

Create a JQL query to fetch desired data (e.g., project = "XYZ" AND status = "In Progress").
Save the filter and use it in dashboards or plugins like eazyBI for advanced reporting.
JIRA Query Language (JQL) Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is JQL in JIRA, and why is it used?

Expected Answer:
JQL (JIRA Query Language) is used to search and filter issues based on conditions.

rules for transitions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burndown Chart
Definition:
A Burndown Chart is a graphical representation that displays the amount of work remaining versus time.
 It shows how quickly a team is "burning" through work (usually measured in story points or hours) in a 
Sprint or project.

Purpose:
Track Progress: Helps the team visualize progress and determine if they are on track to complete the work within the Sprint.
Identify Trends: Reveals patterns such as consistent progress, sudden drops (possibly due to scope changes), or plateaus (potential blockers).
Facilitate Discussions: Acts as a communication tool during daily stand-ups to discuss progress and address impediments.
Components:
X-Axis (Horizontal): Represents time, typically in days for a Sprint.
Y-Axis (Vertical): Represents the amount of work remaining, measured in story points, task hours, or any unit of effort.
How It Works:
Starting Point: At the beginning of the Sprint, the total amount of work is plotted at the top-left corner of the chart.
Ideal Line: A straight line drawn from the starting point to zero at the end of the Sprint represents the ideal progress path.
Actual Progress Line: Each day, the remaining work is calculated and plotted, creating a line that shows the team's actual progress.
Interpreting the Chart:
Above the Ideal Line: Indicates that the team is behind schedule and may not complete all the work by the end of the Sprint.
Below the Ideal Line: Suggests the team is ahead of schedule.
Consistent Decline: A steady decrease shows healthy progress.
Plateaus: Flat lines indicate no progress and may highlight issues that need addressing.
Example:
markdown
Copy code
|\
| \
|  \
|   \
|    \
|     \
|______\____________
     Time →
Note: The above is a simplistic representation. In practice, the chart will have more data points and fluctuations.
Benefits:
Transparency: Provides visibility into the team's progress for all stakeholders.
Early Warning: Highlights potential delays early, allowing the team to take corrective actions.
Motivation: Visual progress can boost team morale.
Velocity Chart
Definition:
A Velocity Chart displays the amount of work a team has completed during previous Sprints. It measures the team's capacity to deliver work, usually in story points.

Purpose:
Predict Future Capacity: Helps estimate how much work the team can take on in upcoming Sprints.
Performance Tracking: Monitors team performance over time to identify trends and areas for improvement.
Planning Aid: Assists in Sprint planning by providing historical data on team throughput.
Components:
X-Axis (Horizontal): Represents individual Sprints.
Y-Axis (Vertical): Represents the amount of work completed, measured in story points or any unit of effort.
Bars: Each bar corresponds to a Sprint and shows:
Estimated Velocity: The planned amount of work.
Actual Velocity: The amount of work completed.
How It Works:
Data Collection: At the end of each Sprint, record the total story points completed.
Chart Creation: Plot this data over multiple Sprints to visualize the team's velocity.
Trend Analysis: Observe the fluctuations and trends to understand team performance.
Interpreting the Chart:
Stable Velocity: Indicates consistent team performance, making future planning more accurate.
Increasing Velocity: May suggest the team is becoming more efficient or possibly underestimating effort.
Decreasing Velocity: Could indicate issues like overcommitment, obstacles, or technical debt.
Example:
markdown
Copy code
Sprint 1  |■■■■■■■■■■| 20 SP
Sprint 2  |■■■■■■■■■■■■| 25 SP
Sprint 3  |■■■■■■■■■■■| 23 SP
Sprint 4  |■■■■■■■■■■■■■| 27 SP
             Story Points →
Note: Each bar represents the total story points completed in that Sprint.
Benefits:
Improved Planning: Provides empirical data to forecast how much work the team can handle.
Performance Insights: Helps identify patterns, such as the impact of external factors on productivity.
Process Improvement: Facilitates discussions during retrospectives to enhance team efficiency.
Comparison and Use Together
Burndown Chart: Focuses on the progress within a single Sprint, helping the team track whether they are on track to meet the Sprint Goal.
Velocity Chart: Looks at performance across multiple Sprints, aiding in long-term planning and forecasting.
By using both charts, teams can manage their current work effectively (Burndown) and plan for future Sprints with greater accuracy (Velocity).

Practical Usage in Agile Teams
In Sprint Planning:
Velocity Chart: Teams review their average velocity to decide how many story points they can commit to in the upcoming Sprint.
During the Sprint:
Burndown Chart: Updated daily to reflect progress, allowing the team to adjust as needed.
In Retrospectives:
Analyze both charts to discuss what went well and what could be improved.
Burndown Chart Issues: If the team consistently ends above the ideal line, they might be overcommitting or facing impediments.
Velocity Fluctuations: Large variations in velocity may prompt discussions about process improvements.
Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Overemphasis on Velocity:

Using velocity as a performance metric can be counterproductive.
Encourage the team to focus on delivering value rather than just increasing velocity.
Ignoring Quality:

Pushing to meet the Burndown Chart expectations at the expense of code quality leads to technical debt.
Misinterpreting Data:

External factors (e.g., team changes, holidays) can affect velocity and should be considered when analyzing charts.
Implementing in Tools like JIRA

Accessible via the Reports section in a JIRA Scrum project.
