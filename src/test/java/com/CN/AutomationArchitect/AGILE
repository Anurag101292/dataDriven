Expected Answer:
Maintain a regression suite in the CI pipeline that runs automatically after every build.
Use risk-based testing to prioritize critical areas during time constraints.
Automate repetitive regression tasks and focus manual testing on new features.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you ensure quality when working on user stories in the same sprint they are developed?
Expected Answer:
Collaborate with developers to define acceptance criteria early.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write test cases during development.
Conduct exploratory testing for edge cases not covered by automation.
Collaboration and Leadership in Agile
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you ensure effective collaboration between QA, development, and product teams?
Expected Answer:
Encourage open communication through daily standups and shared documentation tools like Jira or Confluence.
Foster a collaborative culture where QA is part of development discussions.
Promote the use of shared goals like Definition of Done (DoD).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you handle conflicts between development and testing teams in Agile?
Expected Answer:
Address conflicts collaboratively using data (e.g., logs, screenshots).
Focus on the shared goal of product quality.
Organize a root cause analysis (RCA) session to resolve differences and avoid recurring issues.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you encourage your team to adapt to Agile principles, especially testers coming from a Waterfall background?
Expected Answer:
Conduct Agile workshops and encourage pair testing with developers.
Demonstrate the benefits of early involvement and shorter feedback loops.
Gradually introduce concepts like test automation and CI/CD.
Metrics and Reporting in Agile
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What metrics do you use to track quality in Agile projects?
Expected Answer:
Test coverage: Percentage of code covered by tests.
Defect density: Number of defects per module or feature.
Escaped defects: Defects found in production.
Test execution rate: Number of tests run within a sprint.
Cycle time: Time taken from development to deployment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you handle test reporting in Agile, where timelines are tight?
Expected Answer:
Use tools like Allure or TestRail for automated reporting.
Provide concise daily updates during standups (e.g., pass/fail counts, blockers).
Focus on actionable insights, such as areas with high defect density.
-------------------------
Complex Problem-Solving
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you manage dependencies between testing and development in Agile?
Expected Answer:
Use mock services like WireMock or Mockito to simulate dependencies.
Collaborate with developers to create stubs for incomplete modules.
Prioritize testing independent features early in the sprint.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you handle unstable builds in a CI/CD pipeline?
Expected Answer:
Perform root cause analysis to identify flaky tests or integration issues.
Collaborate with developers to fix critical blockers.
Isolate unstable test cases and run them separately to unblock the pipeline.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would you handle a situation where your team has more defects than they can address in a sprint?
Expected Answer:
Categorize defects by priority and severity.
Collaborate with the product owner to decide which defects must be fixed immediately.
Move lower-priority defects to the backlog and address them in subsequent sprints.
Agile Testing Techniques
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is exploratory testing, and how do you incorporate it in Agile?
Expected Answer:
Exploratory testing involves ad-hoc testing based on tester intuition.
Incorporate it during the sprint to identify edge cases or scenarios that automation may miss.
Pair exploratory testing with documented test charters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you implement behavior-driven development (BDD) in Agile?
Expected Answer:
Collaborate with stakeholders to write scenarios in Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then).
Use tools like Cucumber or Behave to automate these scenarios.
Integrate BDD tests with the CI pipeline for continuous validation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you ensure test data availability in Agile sprints?
Expected Answer:
Use data factories or scripts to dynamically generate test data.
Maintain a shared test data repository for the team.
Use test data management tools like TDM or Mockaroo for consistent data sets.
Agile Challenges and Solutions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the biggest challenges of testing in Agile, and how do you overcome them?
Expected Answer:
Challenge: Short sprints lead to less time for thorough testing.
Solution: Prioritize high-risk areas and automate regression testing.
