It has two parameters: glue and feature:

Feature: The path to the feature file is specified by the feature option.
Glue: The glue argument is used to provide the step definition file's location.
Example:

import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import cucumber.api.CucumberOptions;
import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;
@RunWith (Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions (
features = "src/test/Sample/features ",
glue = {"StepDefinitionFile"}
)
public class SampleTestRunner {
}
29. How does the execution start in Cucumber?
Cucumber execution will begin at the support level. In support,
 it will first load the env.rb file, then hooks.rb, and last start executing feature file scenario steps.
