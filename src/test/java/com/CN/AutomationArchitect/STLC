STLC Phases

1.Requirement Analysis
-----------------------
Objective: Understand the requirements and identify testable aspects of the system.
Activities:
Analyze functional and non-functional requirements.
Identify testing priorities (critical and high-risk areas).
Interact with stakeholders to clarify doubts.
Prepare a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
Deliverables:
Requirement document analysis.
RTM (mapping requirements to test cases).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Test Planning
---------------
Objective: Define the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing.
Activities:
Develop a Test Plan document.
Determine the testing approach (manual, automation, or hybrid).
Identify tools and resources required for testing.
Estimate effort, timelines, and cost.
Identify risks and define mitigation plans.
Deliverables:
Test Plan document.
Risk assessment report.
Resource allocation plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Test Case Design
------------------
Objective: Design and document test cases based on requirements.
Activities:
Create detailed test cases, including test steps, input data, and expected outcomes.
Use techniques like Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), Equivalence Partitioning, and Decision Tables.
Prepare test data for execution.
Deliverables:
Test cases.
Test data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Test Environment Setup
------------------------
Objective: Prepare the testing environment to execute test cases.
Activities:
Set up the hardware, software, and network configurations.
Install required applications, databases, and tools.
Configure test data and simulate test conditions.
Verify the environment with a smoke test.
Deliverables:
Test environment setup.
Smoke test report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Test Execution
----------------
Objective: Execute the prepared test cases to validate the functionality.
Activities:
Execute test cases manually or using automation tools.
Log test results (pass, fail, or blocked).
Report bugs and defects using tools like Jira, Bugzilla, etc.
Retest fixed defects and perform regression testing.
Deliverables:
Test execution results.
Defect reports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Test Closure
--------------
Objective: Finalize the testing process and ensure all objectives are met.
Activities:
Evaluate test completion criteria (coverage, defect count, quality metrics).
Create a Test Summary Report.
Archive test artifacts for future reference.
Conduct a retrospective to analyze lessons learned.
Deliverables:
Test Summary Report.
Retrospective report.
STLC in Agile
In Agile, STLC phases are more iterative and flexible:

Testing starts early, often alongside development.
Test planning and execution are done in each sprint.
Continuous feedback loops and collaboration with developers are emphasized.
Key Benefits of STLC
Ensures a structured approach to testing.
Enhances test coverage and defect detection.
Reduces testing time and cost through early defect detection.
Improves product quality and stakeholder satisfaction.
