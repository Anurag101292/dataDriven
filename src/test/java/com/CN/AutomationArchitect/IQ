TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF?

Currently I am working in TOTAL SYSTEM SERVICE this the part of Global Payments corporation ,
i have around 6.5years of experience in IT which is  in QA and testing  majorly.

Before this I had worked in Healthkart this is product based organisation which provide
food suppliments to their customers , may be you have not heard about healthkart but you must heard about muscleblaze
so there i worked in backend team involved majorly to automate their supply chain managemant of company

 For the technology side
  I have used selenium with java for UI automation ,
 and in backend api testing  I have used Rest assured with java and postman and wrt to other activities like devops
 I am also having some exposure in Jenkins for build and deployment activities and maven ,
 github repositories and git command, docker for monitoring tool I have used SPLUNK AND DYNATRACE
 other then that we are using JIRA ,Confluence for project management
 along with that i have a exposure to setup infrastructure end to end either test case on staging environment.

What are your roles and responsibility ?
Here I worked as a sdet
 Test estimations--Hardware and software resources ,,preparing the test confluence docs according to user requirements ,
   what are the checkmarx which we need to check on PROD post deployemnt validations  together with the code
  what are the application properties which we need to send on production together with code deployment

 writing the testcases , reviewing test cases ,preparing test plan,executing test cases,reporting defects
 and developing automation scripts ,designing and implementing automation frameworks
 does we need to automate the testcases are we able to
                                     automate those scenarios within sprint
  to check monitoring tools alerts need to check what we send in past sprint in prod does those
   functionalities working fine or not also connect with my juniors if they are facing any issues in testing


What are your current project on which you are working ?
  //In recent Project currently we are migrating our old services into new in DB side we are migrating my sql
  // in cassandra and for queuing system we are using kafka now ,
  // SO we are closely working in agile based system using SCRUM approach ,
    I also involved working  with different stakeholders ,QA team dev team and product owner as well
    we have 2 week sprint in which I majorly involved in testing activities like
     understanding requirements,

   What are entry and exit criteria of testing in your current project ?

   Entry criteria you can say that before starting the testing our requirement should be clear as per BRS
                  we have proper setup of environment before starting testing
                  we have proper confluence document of application architecture and changes
                  Analyzing the test approaches in which we are able to
                           validate the functionality as soon as possible
                           to define how much fault we can tolerate
                           what is the accptance bandwith of request and response in production
                           what are the service level agrrements for the project
   Exit Criteria identify all the transactions in modules
                 Ensuring all critical testcases are passed
                 Achiving complete functional coverage
                 identifying and fixing all high priority defects, fixing all show stoppers defects
                 preparing requirement tracibilty matrix
           preparing the test summary report to check every stage of test pyramid that we have complete
           testcoverage of unit testing,integration testing ,System testing and acceptance testing
                 regression reports
                 feed backs in every stage of testing from product owner

Analytical
    Focusing testing on the most critical functionality (risk based)
Model-based
    Stochastic or Monkey testing using random or statistical information (tool).Operational profiles
Methodical Testing approaches
    Failure based (error guessing and fault attack) ,Experience-based
    check-list based and quality characteristic-based

how you can segregate that which testcase need to be automated<TEST AUTOMATION PLANNING > ?

A test case should be automated if:
The task is going to be repeated.
Itâ€™s going to save time.
The requirements, the test, or the task are low risk, stable, and unlikely to change often.
The test is subject to human error.
The test is time consuming.
The test has significant downtime between steps.

TEST PLANNING ?

 Thumbrule to design Automation Framework
         "NEVER HARD CODE
         KEEP THE RIGHT THINGS IN RIGHT PLACE
         FOLLOW THE REUSE CULTURE
         MAKE THE FRAMEWORK EASY FOR MANUAL TESTERS OR OTHERS TO CONTRIBUTE
         MAKE THE FRAMEWORK ROBUST

         Scalability , flowcontrol rate of producing and rate of consuming ,cost
