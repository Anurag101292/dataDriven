Benefits of cloud
-----------------
-->Go global in minutes and deploy applications in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks
-->Trade capital expense for variable expense
-->Benefit from massive economies of scale
-->stop guessing capcity
-->Increase speed and agility

EBS volume can be attached to a single instance in the same Availability Zone (AZ) 
whereas EFS file system can be mounted on instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZ)

AWS Pricing Calculator
----------------------
AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS.
You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, 
and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. 
This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set
of instances and services.
AWS Pricing Calculator can provide the estimate of the AWS service usage based on the list of AWS services.
AWS Cost Explorer -
-----------------
AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your
AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage 
associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view.
The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your
cost trends. 
AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.
AWS Budgets - 
------------
AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed 
(or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage 
targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly,
quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs
associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. 
AWS Budgets cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.

AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
--------------------------------
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is used to automatically distribute your incoming application traffic across all 
the EC2 instances that you are running. You can use Elastic Load Balancing to manage incoming requests by optimally 
routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed. Your load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all 
incoming web traffic to your application. When an instance is added, it needs to register with the load balancer or no 
traffic is routed to it.
When an instance is removed, it must deregister from the load balancer or traffic continues to be routed to it.

1️⃣ Test Infrastructure Setup

Instead of maintaining heavy test machines locally, you can use AWS to provide scalable infra for automation.
Amazon EC2 – Launch Windows/Linux machines with Chrome/Firefox for running Selenium/Playwright tests.
Amazon WorkSpaces – Virtual desktops for running and debugging UI automation in an isolated environment.
Amazon Device Farm – For mobile UI automation (Android/iOS real devices in AWS cloud).
                    It supports Selenium/Appium for web + mobile testing.

✅ Benefit: Pay-as-you-go infra, no need for costly on-prem setups.

2️⃣ Test Execution & Parallelization
For large regression suites, AWS helps run tests in parallel at scale.
AWS Lambda – Serverless test execution for lightweight Playwright/Selenium tests (good for parallel headless runs).
Amazon ECS (Fargate) – Containerize your automation framework (Docker) and run multiple test containers in parallel.
Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) – For enterprise-level orchestration, run distributed automation workloads.

✅ Benefit: Run 100s of tests in parallel without maintaining infra.

3️⃣ Test Data Management
UI automation often needs dynamic test data. AWS provides services to manage this.
Amazon RDS / DynamoDB – Store test data, expected values, and configurations.
AWS Secrets Manager – Securely store credentials (instead of hardcoding usernames/passwords in your framework).
Amazon S3 – Store test artifacts like screenshots, logs, and test reports.

✅ Benefit: Centralized, secure, and scalable test data handling.

4️⃣ CI/CD Integration
You can integrate automation into your build pipelines using AWS.
AWS CodePipeline – Trigger UI automation after deployment.
AWS CodeBuild – Build and run your automation tests inside AWS-managed build environments.
AWS CodeDeploy – Deploy app to a test/stage environment and then kick off automation.

✅ Benefit: End-to-end automation from build → deploy → test.

5️⃣ Reporting & Monitoring

Instead of just HTML reports locally, you can use AWS for centralized reporting and monitoring.
Amazon S3 + CloudFront – Host automation reports for team access.
Amazon CloudWatch – Push test execution logs/metrics for monitoring and alerting.
Amazon QuickSight – Build dashboards for test pass/fail trends, flaky tests, and execution history.

✅ Benefit: Everyone can see live test results, no need to email reports.

6️⃣ Intelligent Enhancements (AI/ML)

You can bring intelligence into your automation with AWS AI services:
Amazon Rekognition – Visual validation of UI (compare expected vs actual screenshots).
Amazon Comprehend – Analyze test logs to find common failure patterns.
Amazon Polly – Voice notifications when a critical test fails (fun but useful in CI/CD).

✅ Benefit: Smarter analysis & validation beyond traditional assertions.
7️⃣ Notifications & Alerts
You can notify teams when tests fail.
Amazon SNS – Send SMS/Email alerts on test failures.
Amazon Chime / Slack via Lambda – Push test summary to collaboration tools.

✅ Benefit: Quicker awareness & debugging.

⚡ Putting it all together (Example Flow)
Developer commits code → AWS CodePipeline triggers build.
CodeBuild deploys app to EC2 test environment.
UI automation (Selenium/Playwright in Docker) runs on ECS/EKS.
Results + screenshots stored in S3.

Logs pushed to CloudWatch.
Summary sent to Slack/WhatsApp/Email via SNS/Lambda.
Dashboard updated in QuickSight for management.
