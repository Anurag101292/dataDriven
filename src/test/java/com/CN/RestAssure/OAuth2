What is Restful service?
   In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered
    resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web.

     The REST architectural style constrains an architecture to a client/server architecture and is designed
     to use a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP.

     Resource identification through URI: A RESTful web service exposes a set of resources that
     identify the targets of the interaction with its clients. Resources are identified by URIs,
     which provide a global addressing space for resource and service discovery. See The @Path Annotation
     and URI Path Templates for more information.

     Uniform interface: Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of four create,
     read, update, delete operations: PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE. PUT creates a new resource,
     which can be then deleted by using DELETE. GET retrieves the current state of a resource in some
     representation. POST transfers a new state onto a resource. See Responding to HTTP Methods and
     Requests for more information.
