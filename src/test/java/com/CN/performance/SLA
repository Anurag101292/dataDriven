✅ What is an SLA?
An SLA is a formal agreement between a service provider and a client/stakeholder that defines the expected performance standards, including:

Metric	Example
✅ Availability	99.9% uptime per month
⏱ Response Time	API response ≤ 2 seconds
📦 Throughput	1000 requests/second
📊 Error Rate	Less than 0.1% failed requests

🧪 In QA/Performance Testing:
SLAs are used to set measurable goals for testing:

Pass criteria: 95% of users should get a response in under 2 seconds

Fail criteria: If 90th percentile > 5s, raise a defect

22. How do you determine performance benchmark or SLA?
Answer:
Benchmarks are usually based on:
Production baselines (monitor real-time usage)
business SLAs (e.g., response time < 2s for 95% users)

Competitive analysis

Define SLA:
Login: 1s for 95% users
Search: ≤3s under 1000 concurrent users
99th percentile response < 5s

🎯 Align with Product, Ops & Devs before testing.
