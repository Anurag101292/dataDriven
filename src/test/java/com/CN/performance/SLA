✅ What is an SLA?
An SLA is a formal agreement between a service provider and a client/stakeholder that defines the expected performance standards, including:

Metric	Example
✅ Availability	99.9% uptime per month
⏱ Response Time	API response ≤ 2 seconds
📦 Throughput	1000 requests/second
📊 Error Rate	Less than 0.1% failed requests

🧪 In QA/Performance Testing:
SLAs are used to set measurable goals for testing:

Pass criteria: 95% of users should get a response in under 2 seconds

Fail criteria: If 90th percentile > 5s, raise a defect
