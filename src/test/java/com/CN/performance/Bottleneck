21. What is a bottleneck and how do you identify it?
Answer:
A bottleneck is a component of the system (CPU, memory, DB, network, etc.) that limits overall performance.

How to identify:

High response time but low throughput = backend issue

CPU > 90% usage = CPU bottleneck

Slow DB queries = indexing or join bottleneck

GC pauses = memory management issue

Tools: JMeter + server metrics (top, Grafana, APM tools like New Relic, Dynatrace)

✅ Real Example:
Login API takes 6 sec under load. APM shows 80% time is in DB query — bottleneck is SQL.
