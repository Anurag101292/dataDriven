👨‍💻 Real Scenario:
In Transact (JPMC), we noticed transaction listing API was timing out for 3% of UAT users.
 Using JMeter + Splunk + APM, we found:

Issue in pagination query (nested sub-select)
Fixed with optimized SQL and better DB indexing
Introduced DB connection pool monitoring + caching layer
Impact: Reduced latency from 7s → 1.2s for 500 concurrent users.
