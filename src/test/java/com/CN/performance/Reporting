âœ… 15. Whatâ€™s the difference between Summary Report, Aggregate Report, and View Results Tree?
Answer:

Listener	Use Case
Summary Report	Simple stats: min, max, avg, error %, throughput
Aggregate Report	More detailed summary + standard deviation
View Results Tree	Debugging: shows request/response body

ðŸ§ª Use View Results Tree only during test design (slows down execution).
