💱 1. SPOT Trade
✅ What is it?
A SPOT trade is the most basic type of FX transaction — where two parties agree to exchange
 one currency for another at the current market rate, known as the spot rate.
📅 Settlement:
T+2: Trade settles two business days after the trade date (T).
Example: Trade on 10 July → settles on 12 July.
📌 Real-World Example:
You buy USD 1 million vs INR at 83.00
On 12 July, you deliver INR 8.3 crore and receive USD 1 million
🎯 Use Case:
Quick FX payments (e.g., for invoices, corporate treasury)


🔁 2. Forward (FWD) Trade
✅ What is it?
A Forward FX trade is a contract where two parties agree to buy/sell currencies at a specified rate but f
or a future date beyond T+2.
📅 Settlement:
Any date after T+2 (e.g., 1 week, 3 months, 1 year)
⚙️ How it works:
Forward Rate = Spot Rate + Forward Points (based on interest rate differentials)
You’re locking in future exchange rate today

📌 Real-World Example:
On 10 July, you agree to buy USD 1M vs INR at 84.50 for delivery on 10 October
🎯 Use Case:
Corporates hedge future payable/receivable FX risk
Investment banks offer forwards to clients

🧪 QA Testing Focus:
Forward points application
Broken date handling (non-standard dates)
Pricing feed and date adjustment logic
Calendar-aware settlement logic (e.g., holidays)

❌ 3. Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF)
✅ What is it?
An NDF is a forward contract for currencies that are not freely convertible (like INR, KRW, CNY). 
Instead of exchanging currencies, cash difference is paid in a convertible currency (usually USD).
⚙️ Key Difference:
Cash-settled — no delivery of local currency
Based on the difference between the contract rate and the fixing rate
🧮 Settlement Formula:
Settlement = (Fixing Rate - Agreed Rate) × Notional
If positive, you gain; if negative, you pay.

📌 Real-World Example:
Book NDF: Sell USD/INR @ 84.00 for 15 Aug
Fixing Rate on 15 Aug: 85.20 → you receive profit in USD
🎯 Use Case:
Hedge currency exposure in restricted markets (India, China)
Offshore investors use it widely (e.g., in Singapore, London)
🧪 QA Testing Focus:
Fetch and apply correct fixing rate
Validate cash settlement amount calculation
Trade lifecycle: Open → Fixing → Settled
MTM (Mark-to-Market) pricing

🔄 4. NDF Swap
✅ What is it?
An NDF Swap is a combination of two NDFs:
One trade to close an existing NDF
Second trade to roll it over to a new maturity date
⚙️ Similar to:
Rollover in forwards (to extend the position)
Can also be used to shift exposure across tenors

📌 Real-World Example:
Existing NDF: Sell USD/INR @ 84.50 for 15 July

NDF Swap: Buy back the 15 July position and sell a new NDF for 15 Aug @ 85.10

🎯 Use Case:
Roll forward exposure
Adjust maturity profile
🧪 QA Testing Focus:
Pairing of old & new NDF trades
Net settlement validation
Breakage logic (e.g., cancelling old trade)
Valuation adjustments during rollover

📆 5. WINFWD (Window Forward)
✅ What is it?
A Window Forward is a flexible forward contract where the buyer/seller can choose a settlement 
date within a defined window (range of dates).
⚙️ Example:
Book a forward for delivery any day between 1 Aug – 10 Aug
📌 Real-World Example:
You agree to sell USD 1M vs INR at 84.75
You can choose to settle on any day between 1–10 Aug
🎯 Use Case:
Used when exact cash flow date is uncertain
Corporates prefer flexibility for receivables/payables

🧪 QA Testing Focus:
Window start and end date validation
Settlement logic for chosen date
Margining based on window duration
Reporting of unsettled vs exercised trades
