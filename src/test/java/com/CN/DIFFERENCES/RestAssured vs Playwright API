| Feature / Aspect          | **RestAssured (Java)**                                                                          | **Playwright API (Java)**                                                             |

| **Primary Purpose**       | Specialized **API testing framework** in Java                                                   | Browser automation + API support                                                      |
| **Dependency**            | External library (`io.rest-assured`)                                                            | Built-in (part of Playwright)                                                         |
| **Ease of Setup**         | Needs Maven/Gradle dependency                                                                   | Comes with Playwright package                                                         |
| **Supported Protocols**   | HTTP/HTTPS (JSON, XML, multipart, form data)                                                    | HTTP/HTTPS (mainly JSON & form data)                                                  |
| **Session Handling**      | Can manage cookies, tokens manually                                                             | Can **share session/cookies with browser context** (huge for hybrid UI+API)           |
| **OAuth2 / Auth Support** | Built-in helpers for OAuth2, Basic, Digest, Preemptive Auth                                     | Supported, but needs manual header/token handling                                     |
| **Schema Validation**     | ✅ Built-in (via `RestAssuredJsonSchemaValidator`)                                               | ❌ No direct schema validation support                                                 |
| **Assertions**            | Strong assertions with `Hamcrest`, JSONPath, XMLPath                                            | Assertions via TestNG/JUnit + JSON parsing manually                                   |
| **Logging**               | Request/response logging is built-in (`given().log().all()`)                                    | Needs manual printing of response body                                                |
| **Data Driven Testing**   | Easily integrates with TestNG, POJO mapping (Jackson/Gson)                                      | Possible, but needs manual mapping/parsing                                            |
| **Community Adoption**    | Widely used in Java QA ecosystem                                                                | Still relatively new for API testing                                                  |
| **Best Use Case**         | **Dedicated API automation framework** (regression suites, schema validation, contract testing) | **Hybrid API + UI automation** (e.g., login via API, continue via UI in same context) |
