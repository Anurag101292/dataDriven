IHookable: If a class implements this interface,
 its run method will be invoked instead of each test method.
  Using the callback method of the IHookCallBack parameter,
   the invocation of the test method can be performed.
   It has a single method name run, which accepts two parameters.
   run(IHookCallBack callBack, ITestResult testResult)Now letâ€™s look into its real-time example.
    In this example, based on a certain parameter value,
     the test shall be skipped using the IHookable listener interface.
 These values will be provided by a data provider in a separate TestNG class.
