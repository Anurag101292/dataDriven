IExecutionListener: As the name suggests, it monitors the beginning and end of TestNG execution.
This listener is mostly used to start/stop the server while starting or ending code execution.
It may also be used to inform respective stakeholders via email that execution shall start or when it ends.
 It has two methods:
onExecutionStart() – invoked before TestNG starts executing the suites
onExecutionFinish() – invoked after all TestNG suites have finished execution
