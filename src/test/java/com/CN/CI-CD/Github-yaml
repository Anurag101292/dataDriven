# Name of the workflow shown in the GitHub Actions UI
name: CI Pipeline

# Defines when this workflow should run
on:
  # Run on push events
  push:
    # Only trigger when pushing to these branches
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

  # Run on pull request events
  pull_request:
    # Only for PRs targeting these branches
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

# A workflow can have one or more jobs
jobs:
  # Job ID (used internally by GitHub)
  build-and-test:
    # Human-readable job name
    name: Build and Test

    # Type of machine to run the job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Strategy allows running the same job multiple times
    # with different configurations
    strategy:
      matrix:
        # Node.js versions to test against
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]

    # Steps are executed in order
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        # Official GitHub action to fetch the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        # Official action to install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # Use Node.js version from the matrix
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          # Enable npm dependency caching to speed up builds
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        # npm ci is recommended for CI environments
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run code linting
      - name: Run lint
        # Fails the build if lint errors are found
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        # Executes unit/integration tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 6: Build the project
      - name: Build project
        # Ensures the application can be built successfully
        run: npm run build
