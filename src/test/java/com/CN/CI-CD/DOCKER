Introduction to Docker:

172.17.0.0/16
 Docker is a very popular and powerful open-source containerization platform that is used for building,
 deploying, and running applications.
 Docker allows you to decouple the application/software from the underlying infrastructure

 What is a Container?
 A container is a standard unit of software bundled with dependencies so that applications can be deployed fast
 and reliably b/w different computing platforms.

 Docker can be visualized as a big ship (docker) carrying huge boxes of products (containers).
 Docker container doesn’t require the installation of a separate operating system. Docker just relies
 or makes use of the kernel’s resources and its functionality to allocate them for the CPU and memory it
  relies on the kernel’s functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory,
  and separate namespaces to isolate the application’s view of the OS (operating system).

2. What are docker images?
They are executable packages(bundled with application code & dependencies, software packages, etc.)
for the purpose of creating containers. Docker images can be deployed to any docker environment and the
containers can be spun up there to run the application.

3. What is a DockerFile?

It is a text file that has all commands which need to be run for building a given image.
           services:
                    jenkins:
                     container_name: jenkins                     (container name)
                     Image: jenkins/jenkins                               (image name)
                     ports:”8080:8080”     [first 8080 ports shows which port we are exposing:the second port shows on which port we map the port on docker]
                     volumes:”$pwd/jenkins_home:var/jenkins_home     [we create a volume because all the
                                 work which we are working on container if we close all data get deleted ,
                                 so to store that data we create volumes and after giving the path we need to map
                                 it with docker container path
                     networks:net  here we share network as net and below i create network on service level.
             networks:
                     -net

 4. Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?
 A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization happen because of which is sometimes referred to
  as the Virtual Machine Monitor.
 This divides the resources of the host system and allocates them to each guest environment installed.

 10. How many Docker components are there?
 There are three docker components, they are - Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry.

 Docker Client: This component performs “build” and “run” operations for the purpose of opening communication
    with the docker host.
 Docker Host: This component has the main docker daemon and hosts containers and their associated images.
    The daemon establishes a connection with the docker registry.
 Docker Registry: This component stores the docker images. There can be a public registry or a private one.
    The most famous public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud.

33. Describe the lifecycle of Docker Container?
The different stages of the docker container from the start of creating it to its end are called the docker
 container life cycle.
The most important stages are:

Created: This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
Running: In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
Paused: This state happens when the running container has been paused.
Stopped: This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
Deleted: In this, the container is in a dead state.

docker --version 	                    to check docker version
docker pull <Image name>             	to download docker image from docker hub
docker ps 	                            to check how many containers up and running
docker run -it -d <image name >	        to create docker container from docker image
docker start <container-id>	            to start docker container
docker restart <container -id >	        to restart container
docker stop <container -id >	        to stop
docker rm <container id >	            to delete docker container
docker rmi 	                            docker image delete
docker images	                        to check for available docker images
docker exec -it <container id> bash 	to get into container and take control on it
exit                                	to come out from container
docker kill <container id >	            to stop container forcefully
docker inspect <container id >      	it will give complete information from container
docker image prune -a               	it will delete images which does not have even a single container
docker run --rm <image name>	        create a docker container and auto remove on exit
docker system prune -a 	                it will delete all the images containers and network which
                                        are not being used to active anymore.
docker compose up -d	                docker start the service by reading docker-compose.yml file
