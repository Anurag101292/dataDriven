3️⃣ kubectl describe pod cfx-ui                 Displays detailed pod configuration, events, restarts, and failure reasons.
4️⃣ kubectl logs cfx-ui                         Fetches application logs from the running container inside cfx-ui.
5️⃣ kubectl logs -f cfx-ui                      Streams live logs from the pod in real time.
6️⃣ kubectl logs cfx-ui --previous              Shows logs from the previous crashed container instance.
7️⃣ kubectl exec -it cfx-ui -- /bin/sh          Executes shell inside the container for debugging and health checks.
8️⃣ kubectl get deploy                          Lists all deployments and their replica status.
9️⃣ kubectl get deploy cfx-ui                   Shows desired, updated, and available replicas for deployment cfx-ui.
🔟 kubectl describe deploy cfx-ui              Displays deployment strategy, pod template, rollout status, and events.
1️⃣1️⃣ kubectl get svc                           Lists all services exposing applications inside the cluster.
1️⃣2️⃣ kubectl get svc cfx-ui                    Shows service type, ports, and cluster IP for cfx-ui.
1️⃣3️⃣ kubectl get endpoints cfx-ui              Shows which pod IPs are receiving traffic for the service.
1️⃣4️⃣ kubectl rollout status deploy/cfx-ui      Checks whether the deployment rollout completed successfully.
1️⃣5️⃣ kubectl rollout undo deploy/cfx-ui        Rolls back deployment to the previous stable version.
1️⃣6️⃣ kubectl scale deploy cfx-ui --replicas=3  Manually scales the application to three running pods.
1️⃣7️⃣ kubectl get events                        Displays recent cluster events useful for debugging failures.
1️⃣8️⃣ kubectl get nodes                         Lists cluster nodes and their readiness status.
1️⃣9️⃣ kubectl top pod cfx-ui                    Shows CPU and memory usage of the pod (metrics server required).
2️⃣0️⃣ kubectl delete pod cfx-ui                 Deletes the pod; Kubernetes recreates it automatically if managed by a deployment.
2️⃣1️⃣ kubectl apply -f cfx-ui.yaml              Creates or updates Kubernetes resources defined in the YAML file.
2️⃣2️⃣ kubectl config current-context            Shows which Kubernetes cluster/context is currently active.
2️⃣3️⃣ kubectl get pods -o wide                  Lists pods with additional details like node name and IP.

🎯 Interview-Ready Closing Line
These commands cover observation, debugging, rollout control, scaling, and recovery for Kubernetes applications in production.

Think of this as “what I type during a prod incident”.

🚨 Production Incident Command Flow (Kubernetes)
🟢 Step 1: Check if Pod Is Running                   kubectl get pods | grep cfx-ui
👉 Confirms pod state: Running, CrashLoopBackOff, Pending.
🟢 Step 2: Check Deployment Health                   kubectl get deploy cfx-ui
👉 Checks desired vs available replicas.
🟢 Step 3: Describe the Pod (MOST IMPORTANT)         kubectl describe pod cfx-ui
👉 Looks for:
Restart reason-->Probe failures-->Image pull errors-->OOMKilled
🟢 Step 4: Check Current Logs                        kubectl logs cfx-ui
👉 Finds runtime errors, exceptions, startup failures.
🟢 Step 5: Check Previous Logs (If Restarting)       kubectl logs cfx-ui --previous
👉 Critical for CrashLoopBackOff analysis.
🟢 Step 6: Verify Service Exists                     kubectl get svc cfx-ui
👉 Ensures traffic exposure is configured.
🟢 Step 7: Check Endpoints (TRAFFIC DEBUG)           kubectl get endpoints cfx-ui
👉 <none> means service not routing to pods.
🟢 Step 8: Check Recent Cluster Events               kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
👉 Detects scheduling, probe, or node failures.
🟢 Step 9: Exec Into Pod (If Needed)                 kubectl exec -it cfx-ui -- /bin/sh
Inside pod:
env      curl localhost:8080/health
👉 Confirms app health internally.
🟢 Step 10: Check Resource Usage                     kubectl top pod cfx-ui
👉 Identifies CPU or memory pressure.
🟢 Step 11: Temporary Recovery Action                kubectl delete pod cfx-ui
👉 Forces clean restart (self-healing validation).
🟢 Step 12: If Deployment Is Broken – Rollback       kubectl rollout undo deploy/cfx-ui
👉 Restores last stable release.
