Difference Between stats, eventstats, and streamstats

| Command       | What it does                                                                   | Output affects original events? | Use Case Example                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stats`       | Aggregates events and returns summary results (like SQL `GROUP BY`)            | ❌ No original events remain     | Count total errors per service                             |
| `eventstats`  | Aggregates data like `stats`, but **adds results back to each matching event** | ✅ Original events remain        | Add total count to each event for context                  |
| `streamstats` | Performs **running or cumulative statistics** on each event as it arrives      | ✅ Original events remain        | Cumulative count, running average, first/last values, etc. |

✅ 1. stats – Summary only (like SQL GROUP BY)

index=web_logs status=500
| stats count by uri_path


✅ 2. eventstats – Adds stats to each event (without removing them)

index=web_logs status=500
| eventstats count as total_500s

✅ 3. streamstats – Row-wise stats (running calculations)

index=web_logs status=500
| streamstats count as running_500s
