✅ 5. What is a Splunk forwarder? How is it different from an indexer?
Answer:

A Splunk forwarder is an agent installed on source machines (like app servers or test servers) to collect and send data to Splunk.

There are two types:

Universal Forwarder (UF) – lightweight, used for log forwarding

Heavy Forwarder (HF) – can parse/filter data before sending (rare in QA use)

An indexer is a Splunk component that receives data from forwarders, parses it, and stores it in searchable indexes.

| Role      | Splunk Forwarder        | Splunk Indexer                      |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose   | Collect & forward data  | Parse, index & store data           |
| Location  | Source machine (QA box) | Central Splunk server or cloud      |
| CPU Usage | Very low                | Higher (handles storage & querying) |
