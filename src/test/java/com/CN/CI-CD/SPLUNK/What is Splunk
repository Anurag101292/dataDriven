Splunk is a data analytics and log management platform used to collect, index, monitor, and analyze machine-generated data 
from various sources such as servers, applications, databases, and network devices.
It works in three major steps:

Ingest: Splunk collects data from different sources using forwarders, APIs, or file monitoring.

Index: The raw data is parsed and indexed for faster search and retrieval.

Search & Visualize: Users can query the data using SPL (Search Processing Language) to generate reports, dashboards, and alerts.
