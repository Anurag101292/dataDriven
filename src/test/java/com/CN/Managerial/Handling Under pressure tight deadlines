Situation:
In a Forex trading platform modernization project at [Your Company Name], 
I was part of a cross-functional team tasked with integrating
 a real-time currency rate aggregation engine with enhanced latency performance. 
This project had high visibility from leadership due to upcoming regulatory compliance changes and competitive product launches from rival platforms.

Challenge:
Just two weeks before the go-live date, we were notified of a mandatory update from one of our key 
rate providers (a third-party API) that significantly changed their response structure. 
This affected downstream parsing logic, risk engine calculations, and UI display of real-time currency pairs. 
The team was already working at capacity, and any delay could result in missing our go-live, impacting SLAs and trader confidence.

Actions Taken:
Immediate Assessment & Prioritization: I quickly performed an impact analysis and broke down the changes into three categories 
â€” core engine parsing updates, regression automation changes, and UI recalibration. 
I prioritized critical-path tasks (parser and rate accuracy validation) for immediate action.

Parallel Workstream Creation: I created mini-sprints within the tight 2-week window. 
Backend parsing logic was handled by 2 developers,
 while I personally took up writing validation automation using Java + RestAssured to ensure rate consistency across providers.

Cross-Team Coordination: I initiated daily syncs between devs, QA, and product to address 
blockers faster and coordinated with the third-party provider for clarifications.

Risk Mitigation: I also implemented feature flags so that the UI team could toggle 
between old and new parser results in lower environments without blocking frontend validation.

Result:
We delivered the update 2 days before the deadline, with 100% test coverage on the new parser logic and no post-deployment issues. 
The product team appreciated the clear prioritization strategy and the smooth transition under pressure.
