I believe I’m a strong fit for this role at BlackRock for three key reasons: technical depth, leadership mindset, 
and alignment with your mission.

First, I bring deep expertise in automation testing, both UI and API level, using tools like Playwright, Selenium, RestAssured, and Karate. 
I’ve successfully migrated large-scale frameworks, managed regression pipelines with Jenkins, and integrated reporting tools like Allure, 
showing my ability to build robust QA systems that scale.

Second, in my current role at JPMorgan Chase, I manage a QA team across global time zones, 
streamline shift-left testing practices,
 and work closely with developers to improve test efficiency and system resilience.
 These experiences make me confident in handling cross-functional collaboration and delivery accountability, 
which are crucial for a role like this at BlackRock.

Third, I’ve always been passionate about delivering quality with efficiency, and I admire how BlackRock, 
through platforms like Aladdin, builds trust in the global financial system. 
I want to be part of a team that not only solves technical problems, but contributes to systems that impact global markets.

Lastly, I’m not just looking for a job — I’m looking to grow with a purpose-driven company like BlackRock.
 With my background, adaptability, and drive to innovate in the QA space, I’m confident I can bring immediate value to the 
team and keep growing along with it.”
