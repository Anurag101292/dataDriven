‚úÖ How I Define KPIs for the QA Team
I align KPIs with project goals, business outcomes, and team maturity. Here‚Äôs how I break them down:

üîπ 1. Test Coverage KPIs
Definition: Measures how much of the application is covered by automated or manual tests.
KPI Examples:
% of functional requirements covered by test cases.
% of automation coverage (UI, API, unit tests).
Tools:
TestRail, Zephyr, or Xray integrated with JIRA.
SonarQube or Jacoco for unit test code coverage.

üîπ 2. Defect Metrics
Definition: Tracks the number and severity of defects to assess product quality.
KPI Examples:
Defect Leakage Rate = (Defects found in UAT/Prod) / (Total defects found)
Defect Reopen Rate
Severity-wise defect distribution

Tools:
JIRA (with Dashboards, Filters, JQL)
Power BI or Tableau for visual dashboards

üîπ 3. Test Execution KPIs
Definition: Measures test execution progress and efficiency.
KPI Examples:
Test execution progress = (Test cases executed / Total test cases) √ó 100
Pass/Fail ratio of test cases
Execution productivity = Test cases executed per day per tester

Tools:
TestRail, Zephyr, QMetry integrated with JIRA
Jenkins/CI Tools for automation test execution tracking

üîπ 4. Automation KPIs
Definition: Measures automation ROI and stability.
KPI Examples:
Automation script pass rate
Script maintenance effort
Time saved via automation
Automation stability index (flaky test %)

Tools:
Allure, Extent Reports, or ReportPortal
Jenkins + TestNG/Cucumber + Slack integration for daily stability

üîπ 5. Sprint/Agile KPIs
Definition: Agile-centric metrics to measure QA efficiency in sprints.
KPI Examples:
QA story point burn-down
QA capacity utilization
Time to test story post-dev completion
Tools:
JIRA Agile Boards + Confluence for test planning
Jira Velocity Charts, or plug-ins like EazyBI, Agile Reports for Jira

üîπ 6. Team Performance and Quality
Definition: Assess team skills, ownership, and improvements.
KPI Examples:
Peer code review quality
Knowledge sharing sessions done per month
Number of escaped defects per team member
