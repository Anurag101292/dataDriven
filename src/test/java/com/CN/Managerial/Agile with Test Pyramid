Agile processes emphasize speed and efficacy. The testing pyramid offers by streamlining the testing process.
 With a clear progression and logic introduced to the testing pipeline, work gets done faster.
  Since the pyramid is built to run the easiest tests at the beginning, testers manage time better,
   get better results and essentially make life easier for everyone involved.
The pyramid provides testers with the right priorities. If test scripts are written with a greater focus on the
 UI, then chances are that core business logic and back-end functionality is not sufficiently verified.
 This affects product quality and leads to more work for the team. Also, since TAT (turn around time) of UI
 tests is high, it leads to lower test coverage overall. By implementing the pyramid, such situations are
  completely avoided.
In automated testing, tools and frameworks like Selenium execute scripted tests on a software application or
component to ensure it is working as expected. Its entire objective is to reduce human effort and oversight.
 But for a machine to yield the right results, it must be given the right direction.

The test automation pyramid strives to do this by organizing and structuring the test cycle.
 This streamlines the entire processes, brings efficient time management into the picture and gives testers a
  time-tested blueprint to shape their projects.
