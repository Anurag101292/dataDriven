In our project, our test strategy is Agile-focused. We start with story grooming to understand requirements and identify test scenarios early. 
We follow shift-left testing, covering API and UI layers. Smoke and regression are automated using Playwright and RestAssured, integrated into Jenkins. 
Test data is handled via mocks and seeded scripts, and environments are synced with dev. 
We track defects in JIRA, prioritize based on severity, and conduct RCA for production bugs. Our strategy ensures fast feedback, high coverage, and quality at speed.

✅ First: What is a Test Strategy?
A Test Strategy is a high-level document or approach that outlines how testing will be carried out across the project or organization.

It answers:

What to test?

How to test?

Who will test?

When will testing be done?

Where will it be executed?

Why we are testing in that way?

✅ Structure Your Answer Like This:
🧩 1. Objective & Scope
"The goal of the test strategy is to ensure the application meets business and technical requirements with high quality."
Define what's in scope and out of scope for testing (UI, API, DB, performance, etc.)
Example: Functional, Non-functional, Regression, Smoke, Sanity, UAT

🧪 2. Types of Testing Covered
“We use a mix of manual and automation testing depending on the scenario.”
Unit Testing – done by Dev
API Testing – automated using RestAssured/Postman
UI Testing – using Selenium/Playwright
Regression Testing
Smoke/Sanity Testing
Performance Testing – JMeter/Gatling
Security Testing – optional based on domain

🔁 3. Test Levels
“We follow a layered approach starting from Unit to UAT.”

Level	Owner	Tools Used
Unit	Dev	JUnit, TestNG
API / Service	QA	RestAssured, Postman
UI	QA	Playwright, Selenium
Integration	QA/Dev	WireMock, Karate
UAT	Business	Manual Validation

🤖 4. Automation Strategy
“We automate smoke and regression suites to speed up testing in CI/CD.”
Frameworks: Playwright, RestAssured, TestNG, Allure
Automation scope: High-priority and stable test cases
CI integration: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
Reporting: Allure / Extent / HTML reports

📊 5. Test Planning & Estimation
“We estimate effort based on story points, risk, and complexity.”
Use t-shirt sizing or hour-based estimation
Involve QA in grooming sessions
Define test deliverables: test cases, data, execution plan, reports

💾 6. Test Data & Environment
“We manage data via test databases, mocks, and seeded scripts.”
Tools: WireMock, DB scripts
Environments: DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD
Ensure sync between test and dev environments

🧩 7. Defect Management
“We use JIRA to log, track, and close defects. Prioritize by severity and impact.”
Triaging with Dev/Product
Linking defects to user stories/test cases

⚠️ 8. Risk Management
“We identify risks early — e.g., unstable features, late code merges, lack of test data.”
Risk-based testing
Smoke testing after every build

📈 9. Metrics & Reporting
“We share daily status, blockers, test execution reports, and defect summary.”
Test case pass/fail rate
Defect leakage
Automation coverage
Sprint test summary

💬 10. Collaboration
“We work closely with Dev, BA, and Product in an Agile model — daily standups, reviews, retros.”
