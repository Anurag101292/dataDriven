✅ Key Aspects to Consider
🔹 Costs (Investment)
--> Tool Licensing Cost
     --Cost of purchasing commercial tools (e.g., UFT, TestComplete).
     --Subscription for tools like BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, etc.

-->Team & Resource Cost
   --Salaries of automation engineers.
   --Training time/costs to upskill team.
   --Cost of maintaining automation scripts over time.

-->Infrastructure Cost
   --Servers, cloud execution platforms (if not already available).
   --CI/CD integration time.
  
-->Initial Development Time
   --Time spent creating the automation framework and writing scripts.


🔹 Benefits (Returns)
Time Saved
   Faster test execution compared to manual testing.
   Frequency of test runs (e.g., nightly, on PR merge, etc.).

Parallel execution.
   Manual Effort Saved
   Reduction in manual QA hours for repetitive test cases.

Improved Coverage
   Test more scenarios (cross-browser, devices, large datasets).

Faster Releases
   Helps in faster feedback, early bug detection → faster releases → competitive edge.

Bug Detection Cost Saving
   Bugs found early are cheaper to fix.

ROI (%) = [(Net Benefit - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost] * 100

Suppose:
500 regression test cases
Manual execution per cycle = 5 mins/test → ~42 hours
Automation execution per cycle = 2 hours total
Regression cycles = 10 per release
Cost of automation effort = 300 hours (initial) + 20 hours per release maintenance
Savings per release = (42 hrs × 10) – (2 hrs × 10) = 420 – 20 = 400 hours saved
Cost of automation = 300 + 20 = 320 hours

𝑅𝑂𝐼=((400−320)/320)×100=25%
