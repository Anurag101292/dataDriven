why do you want to join

“I want to join BlackRock because it’s a company that perfectly aligns with both my technical aspirations and personal values.

First, BlackRock is not just a financial firm — it’s a technology-driven leader. Products like Aladdin 
show how seriously the company takes innovation, data, and scale. 
As someone who has built test automation frameworks and managed quality for complex financial platforms,
 I see a huge opportunity to contribute to something that truly impacts global markets.

Second, I deeply value the way BlackRock operates — with discipline, long-term thinking, and a commitment to doing what’s right for
 clients. 
That resonates with how I approach my own work: with ownership, quality, and a focus on building systems that last.

Finally, I see BlackRock as a place where I can grow as a technology leader — surrounded by talented teams, learning opportunities, 
and meaningful challenges.
 Joining BlackRock wouldn’t just be a career move; it would be a step toward creating a wider impact through technology.”
