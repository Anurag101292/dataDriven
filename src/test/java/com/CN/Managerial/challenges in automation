One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the migration of our automation framework from Selenium to Playwright.

The main challenge wasn’t just tool migration — it was redesigning the entire automation architecture to make it faster, maintainable, and CI/CD friendly. Selenium tests were slow and flaky, and we had multiple duplicated utilities for API calls and data handling.

So I first analyzed the test pyramid and realized many UI tests could be shifted to API or integration level. I created a wrapper layer in Playwright for common actions like login, navigation, and reusable API utilities. This helped us reduce 30–40% redundancy.

Another major challenge was with parallel execution and environment data collisions — because multiple test runs were hitting the same API endpoints or DB records. I solved this by using dynamic test data generation and introducing an environment tagging system so each test run was isolated.

Finally, I integrated it with Jenkins + Slack + Jira using webhooks (and later n8n) so test reports and failures were automatically shared.

The impact was huge — execution time reduced from ~2 hours to ~25 minutes, flakiness went down, and the team gained confidence to run the suite before every merge.

This experience taught me that challenges aren’t just technical — they’re about creating sustainable processes and frameworks that the whole team can rely on.”
