Since I collaborate with teams across UK and US time zones, my workday starts at 12 PM IST, 
aligning with their core hours for better productivity and communication.

1. Start of the Day
I begin by checking critical emails and calendar invites. My priority is to review:
Production and UAT health checks to detect any early warnings
Critical incidents reported on our production support Slack/Teams channel
Upcoming meetings or action items requiring my input

2. Morning Stand-up (QA Focus)
We have a daily QA stand-up where we review the Jira board for our sprint. I work with my team to:
Track test progress and blockers
Align on ongoing automation tasks
Redistribute tasks if someone needs support

3. Jira Sprint Tasks and Testing
Post stand-up, I pick up stories from the sprint board for:
Functional, regression, or integration testing
API testing using RestAssured
Enhancing or debugging Playwright automation scripts
Validating data and backend workflows

4. Collaboration with London Team (2:30 PM IST)
In our London stand-up, we review progress on shared Jira stories, dependency updates, and release blockers.
I also assist the team with any technical discussions or clarifications.

5. Backlog Grooming / Demos (Ad-hoc)
During the day, I participate in backlog refinement, product demos, and sprint planning, ensuring QA 
inputs are included earlyâ€”this supports our shift-left testing approach.

6. Jersey Team Sync (8:00 PM IST)
We wrap up with our New Jersey team, where we:

Discuss stories in progress
Share QA feedback on deployed features
Align on next-day priorities and production validations

Throughout the day, I monitor test results from our CI pipelines, analyze failed builds, and raise defects or clarifications proactively.
