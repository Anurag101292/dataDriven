🧠 Example Response in an Interview:
“If a production bug is reported, I first try to reproduce it using the client’s data and logs. Once confirmed, 
I work with Dev to isolate the root cause and prioritize the fix. If it’s critical, we raise a hotfix and validate 
the resolution in UAT. Post-resolution, I perform RCA to understand how we missed it — was it a gap in coverage,
 unclear requirement, or data mismatch? Finally, I ensure the scenario is added to our test suite to prevent recurrence.”

When a client reports a production bug that wasn’t caught during testing, it’s a critical moment that requires a calm, 
structured, and action-oriented response. Here's a professional way to handle it:

✅ Step-by-Step Approach
1. 🔍 Acknowledge & Triage the Bug Immediately
Thank the client and acknowledge the issue quickly.
Classify the bug based on Severity and Priority.
Try to reproduce the bug using the exact steps or data shared by the client.
🗣️ “We’ve received your issue report and are actively investigating it. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.”

2. 🛠️ Reproduce in Lower Environment
Use production logs, user ID, timestamp, and input data to recreate the issue in a lower environment (like UAT or Staging).
Use monitoring tools like Splunk, ELK, New Relic, or Grafana to trace errors.
🎯 Goal: Identify root cause and validate whether it’s a code defect, data issue, infra problem, or configuration miss.

3. ⚡ Hotfix or Patch if Needed
If the issue is critical (P1/Critical):
Coordinate with Dev, QA, Infra, and Release teams for an emergency hotfix.
Write targeted test cases to cover the scenario.
Deploy to prod via a controlled pipeline (with rollback strategy in place).

4. ✅ Retest and Validate
Once the fix is ready:
Validate in QA/UAT environment with the exact prod scenario.
Run regression tests to ensure no side effects.
After deploying to prod, validate with the client that the issue is resolved.

5. 📘 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Conduct a retrospective or blameless RCA session.
Ask:
Why wasn’t it caught earlier?
Was it a missed test case?
Was the test data incomplete?
Was the scenario out of scope?

✅ Create an RCA document outlining:
Problem
Root cause
Resolution
Preventive action

6. 🔁 Improve Test Coverage
Add missing test cases (manual + automation).
Update test data and edge case scenarios.
Include the new bug in the regression suite.
