| **Open-source vs Commercial** | Tools like Playwright, REST Assured, and Karate are open-source. Tools like **Tricentis           |
                                  Tosca**, **UFT**, **ReadyAPI (SoapUI Pro)** require paid licenses.                                |
| **Hidden Costs**              | Even open-source tools may require investment in custom framework development,                    |               
                                  training, infrastructure.                                                                         |
| **Budget Approval**           | Will business approve the cost for licenses, cloud executions, dashboards, or managed support?    |

TEAM SIZE AND SKILL SET 
| Factor                    | Considerations                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Current Team Skills**   | If your team knows Java, REST Assured or Playwright (Java) is a natural fit.                           |
                              If they're strong in JavaScript, Cypress or Playwright (JS) works better.                              |
| **Learning Curve**        | DSL-based tools (Karate, Cypress) are easier to ramp up. REST Assured or                               |
                              Selenium may require more programming background.                                                      |
| **Support/Training Cost** | Will you need to train team members? Is documentation and community support strong enough?             |
| **Bandwidth**             | Can your existing team maintain and scale the framework or do you need more hires?                     |

Scalability & Maintainance Overhead
| Factor                   | Considerations                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Framework Complexity** | A tool may be powerful but too complex for your current team size. |
| **Maintenance Overhead** | Will the framework need frequent updates? Are test failures flaky? |
| **Onboarding Time**      | How quickly can a new QA join and contribute?                      |

StakeHolder & Ecosystem fit

| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev/DevOps Buy-in**             | Will developers support adding mocks, test data, and testability hooks in the code? |
| **Tool Popularity in Org**        | Is the tool already in use across teams? Is there a center of excellence (CoE)?     |
| **Dev Environment Compatibility** | Does it work well with your current tech stack (Java Spring Boot, React, etc.)?     |

| **PoC Setup Time**         | How long will it take to get a working proof of concept (PoC)?                        |
| **Framework Setup Time**   | REST Assured or Selenium may need framework setup from scratch; Karate and            |
                               Playwright CLI are quicker to start.                                                  |
| **Test Development Speed** | DSL-based tools like Karate or Cypress can accelerate writing tests.                  |
