2. Team Bonding Problem: Resolving Conflicts in a Diverse Team
Problem: You are leading a team of QA engineers spread across different geographies. Cultural differences, 
time zone mismatches, and varying levels of technical expertise are causing conflicts and reducing productivity.

Challenges:

Junior team members feel unheard, while senior members dominate discussions.
Team members in different time zones feel excluded from key decisions.
Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are minimal.

Solution:

Encourage Inclusive Communication:
Implement a "round-table" rule during meetings where every team member gets a chance to speak.
Use async communication tools like Confluence or Slack to allow team members to contribute outside real-time discussions.
Bridge the Skill Gap:
Pair junior testers with experienced members for mentoring.
Organize technical workshops to upskill the team, focusing on automation, API testing, or performance testing.
Celebrate Diversity:
Host virtual events where team members can share cultural traditions or personal interests to build rapport.
Adapt Workflow for Time Zones:
Use tools like Jira or ClickUp to track tasks, ensuring visibility of everyone's progress.
Create overlapping working hours for critical discussions but allow flexibility otherwise.
