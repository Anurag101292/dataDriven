1. Project Architecture Problem: Incomplete Test Coverage in a Microservices Architecture
Problem: You are leading testing for a project built on a microservices architecture. Each service has independent teams, 
and there's no unified test strategy. End-to-end (E2E) testing is inconsistent, and critical defects are often discovered 
late in production.

Challenges:

Limited communication between service teams leads to mismatched expectations and integration issues.
Testing each service in isolation doesn't guarantee that they work together.
The team lacks a centralized testing framework, leading to duplicated effort.
Solution:

Introduce a Contract Testing Framework:
Implement tools like Pact to validate interactions between services.
Create a centralized repository for service contracts to ensure each service adheres to expected inputs and outputs.
Establish End-to-End Testing Strategies:
Build a lightweight, scalable E2E framework using tools like Playwright or Selenium Grid for UI flows and Postman for
APIs.
Use a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run these tests upon deployment.
Foster Collaboration:
Organize regular "microservices alignment" meetings with developers and QA leads from each service team.
Create shared Slack/Teams channels for faster communication.
Monitor and Analyze:
Use observability tools like New Relic or Dynatrace to monitor inter-service communication and detect integration 
bottlenecks early.
