ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Acknowledge the Conflict
I would not ignore the conflict, because unresolved conflicts impact morale and productivity.
First, Iâ€™d bring both team members into a private, neutral discussion (never in front of the team).

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Understand Perspectives
Iâ€™d let each member explain their side without interruption.
As a manager, I need to actively listen and identify the root cause 
(e.g., misunderstanding, workload distribution, ownership overlap).

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Find Common Ground & Resolution
Iâ€™d re-align both members on the shared goal (team success over individual differences).
If itâ€™s a work allocation issue, Iâ€™d redefine responsibilities clearly.
If itâ€™s personal friction, Iâ€™d set a code of collaboration with agreed doâ€™s/donâ€™ts.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Balance With My Own Tasks
I would not let conflict derail my own deliverables.
To handle this, Iâ€™d:
Delegate operational tasks where possible.
Time-box conflict resolution discussions (avoid endless debates).
Escalate only if conflict persists beyond a reasonable limit.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Follow-Up
After resolution, Iâ€™d keep an eye on collaboration between the two members for the next few sprints.
Encourage peer recognition (have them appreciate each otherâ€™s contributions).

âœ… Sample Interview Answer (STAR approach):
"In one of my past projects, two team members disagreed on ownership of test automation scripts. 
On the last sprint day, this created tension. I called both into a private discussion, listened to their
perspectives, and realized it was due to unclear ownership. I realigned responsibilities and set up a weekly 
sync to avoid overlap. Meanwhile, I continued with my own deliverables by delegating some review tasks to a 
senior QA in the team. Within the next sprint, collaboration improved, and delivery was on track."
