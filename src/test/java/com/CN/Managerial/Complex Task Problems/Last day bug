Let's say I am testing in the biweekly sprint, and on the last day of the sprint,
 I got 4 blocker issue ,when I raise these issue to dev lead he told that to resolve this issue 
it will take 3 business day , also why didn't you raise this issue in beginning , 
How I can takle this question in an interview

"In one of the sprints, on the last day during regression testing, I found 4 blocker issues that were critical to business functionality."

Task:
"My responsibility was to raise them immediately and ensure stakeholders were aware, but the dev lead was frustrated, asking why these werenâ€™t found earlier."

Action:
"I first clarified the context:
I had already followed our normal QA process (story testing, sanity checks earlier in sprint).
These blockers only surfaced during end-to-end regression, where multiple integrated modules were tested together.
I explained this calmly to the dev lead, acknowledging the concern and showing test evidence.

Next, instead of debating, I focused on solutions:
I flagged the issues in Jira as Blockers, notified the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
I proposed options: either extend the sprint by a few days to fix blockers or move them 
to the next sprint with proper prioritization.

Meanwhile, I suggested a temporary workaround to unblock UAT testing."

Result:
"This showed that I take responsibility while staying solution-oriented. The team agreed to fix the most 
critical 2 blockers immediately and planned the other 2 for the next sprint.
Afterwards, I took an action item:

I added an earlier mid-sprint regression cycle to minimize such late surprises.

Also included shift-left checks (API automation + mocking) to detect defects before full integration."
