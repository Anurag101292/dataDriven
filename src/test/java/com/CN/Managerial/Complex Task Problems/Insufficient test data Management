5. Project Architecture Problem: Inefficient Test Data Management
Problem: Your automation framework is struggling due to a lack of consistent and reusable test data. 
Test scripts frequently fail because of missing or corrupt data in the staging environment, delaying releases.

Challenges:

Testers spend significant time preparing test data manually.
Scripts are not resilient to changes in the database or APIs.
Reusing test data causes false negatives in test results.
Solution:

Centralized Test Data Management:
Create a test data management system using tools like Mockaroo or Faker to generate synthetic test data.
Maintain a version-controlled repository for test data files in formats like JSON or YAML.
Use Test Data Factories:
Build utilities within your framework to dynamically generate test data for different scenarios.
Isolate Tests:
Ensure test scripts clean up the data they create (e.g., delete users or records after the test).
Leverage mock services like WireMock or Mockito to reduce dependency on live data.
Environment Reset Mechanisms:
Automate database resets and seed data scripts as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Summary:
These examples demonstrate your ability to handle technical and interpersonal challenges. When presenting these scenarios in an interview:

Use the STAR framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.
Highlight both leadership skills (delegation, collaboration) and technical expertise (tools, strategies).
Emphasize measurable outcomes, such as reduced downtime, increased test coverage, or improved team morale.
