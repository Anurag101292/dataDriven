✅ What I Automate
1️⃣ Business-Critical Flows
Login, payments, order creation, trade flow, reports, etc.
Because:
High business impact     Used by many users      Must never break

2️⃣ High Regression Areas
Features touched in every release
Because:
Manual regression is expensive
High chance of defects

3️⃣ API & Integration Tests (Maximum ROI)
Service-to-service flows
Contract validation
Because:
Fast   Stable    Give maximum coverage

4️⃣ Data-Driven & Repetitive Tests
Same flow with 100 datasets  Because:
Machines are perfect for repetition

5️⃣ Happy Paths & Key Negative Paths
Not every edge case in UI Only:
Core flows      High-risk validations

❌ What I Do NOT Automate
1️⃣ Frequently Changing UI Because:
Maintenance cost > value
2️⃣ One-Time Test Cases
Data migration
One-time release validations
3️⃣ Highly Visual / UX / Subjective Checks
Font alignment
Color, look & feel
Better done manually or with visual tools
4️⃣ Very Complex Scenarios with Low Business Value
Huge setup      Rarely executed          Low ROI
🎯 Decision Formula (Very Strong Line)

If maintenance cost is higher than execution value, I don’t automate it.
