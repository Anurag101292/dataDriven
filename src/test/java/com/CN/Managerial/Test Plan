Great! If the interviewer asks about a "Test Plan", here’s what they’re looking for:

How you approach a specific feature or release

How you organize your testing tasks

What your timeline, scope, and ownership look like

How you ensure risk coverage, traceability, and execution visibility

✅ Difference Between Test Plan vs Test Strategy:
Aspect	Test Strategy	Test Plan
Level	Organization / Project-wide	Feature / Sprint / Release specific
Focus	High-level approach and policy	Practical, executable steps for a test cycle
Owner	QA Manager / Test Architect	Test Lead / Senior QA
Static/Dynamic	Usually static	Can be updated dynamically per sprint

✅ What to Cover When Asked About a Test Plan
You can structure your answer using these 8 key components:

1. 🎯 Objective
“The goal is to validate that the feature meets business and technical requirements.”

What is being tested?

Why is this test plan being created?

2. 🧩 Scope
“We’re covering both positive and negative flows for the new payment module.”

In-Scope: What features, modules, integrations

Out-of-Scope: What will not be tested (e.g., legacy modules)

3. 🧪 Test Types & Approach
“We’re using manual testing for exploratory and automation for regression.”

Functional Testing (UI, API)

Regression

Smoke/Sanity

Non-functional (if applicable: performance, security)

4. 🗓️ Test Schedule & Timeline
“We align testing with sprint goals; test planning starts after story grooming.”

Include start date, end date

Mention test case writing, test execution, defect validation

5. 👥 Roles & Responsibilities
“I’m leading the test plan, assigning test cases to the team, and reviewing execution.”

Role	Responsibility
QA Lead	Plan, coordinate, report
QA Engineer	Write/execute test cases
Dev	Fix defects, support testing
BA/PO	Clarify requirements, accept UAT

6. 🔁 Entry & Exit Criteria
“We enter testing once stories are dev complete and unit tested.”

Entry Criteria: Code is deployed, environments are ready, data available

Exit Criteria: All critical test cases passed, defects resolved/closed

7. ⚠️ Risk & Mitigation
“Test data unavailability or environment instability may cause delays.”

Risk	Mitigation
Environment down	Use backup/mocked services
Delayed development	Parallel test planning/automation
Unclear requirements	Continuous sync with BAs

8. 📊 Deliverables
“We’ll deliver test cases, test execution report, defect summary, and RCA.”

Test case documents (manual + automated)

Execution report (with pass/fail count)

Defect list with severity and priority

Final test sign-off email

🧠 Sample Answer in an Interview:
“Whenever we begin testing a new feature, 
we prepare a test plan that outlines the objective, scope, and test types. 
For example, when we delivered the new forex dashboard, I led the test planning. 
We included functional, regression, and API-level validation. Entry was set once code was deployed to SIT,
 and we exited after full regression passed and critical defects were closed. Risks like data unavailability 
were mitigated by mocking APIs. We tracked everything in JIRA and delivered a test report with sign-off to 
stakeholders.”

🔧 Tools You Can Mention:
JIRA (for test cases/defects)

TestRail / XRay (for test planning)

Confluence (to store test plan doc)

Jenkins/GitHub Actions (CI integration)
