Great! If the interviewer asks about a "Test Plan", here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre looking for:
How you approach a specific feature or release
How you organize your testing tasks
What your timeline, scope, and ownership look like
How you ensure risk coverage, traceability, and execution visibility

‚úÖ Difference Between Test Plan vs Test Strategy:
Aspect	Test Strategy	Test Plan
Level	Organization / Project-wide	Feature / Sprint / Release specific
Focus	High-level approach and policy	Practical, executable steps for a test cycle
Owner	QA Manager / Test Architect	Test Lead / Senior QA
Static/Dynamic	Usually static	Can be updated dynamically per sprint

‚úÖ What to Cover When Asked About a Test Plan
You can structure your answer using these 8 key components:

1. Test Plan Identifier
Document ID: TP-PROJ-2025-001
Version: 1.0

2. Introduction
Brief overview of the project/product being tested.
Example: ‚ÄúThis test plan covers the QA strategy for the Flight Booking module of MakeMyTrip application, ensuring functional correctness, performance, and usability.‚Äù

3. Objectives & Scope
In Scope:
Functional testing of Flight Search & Booking
UI validations (Playwright)
API validations (RestAssured)
Regression suite execution
Mocking downstream services using Karate

Out of Scope:
Performance testing of downstream services
Third-party payment gateway validations (handled by vendor)

4. Test Strategy / Approach

Levels of Testing:
Unit Testing (by Dev team)
Integration Testing (mock downstream via Karate)
System Testing (end-to-end with real SIT environment)
Regression Testing (bi-weekly)
Types of Testing:
Functional (positive & negative)
UI automation with Playwright
API automation with RestAssured
Compatibility testing across Chrome, Edge, Firefox
Smoke Testing before every release
Test Data Management:
Mock data for airline search scenarios
Masked production data for regression

5. Test Environment
SIT, UAT, PROD (read-only validation)
Tools: Playwright, Karate, Jenkins, WireMock
Browsers: Chrome (latest), Edge (latest), Firefox

6. Test Deliverables
Test Plan document
Test Cases (manual & automated)
Test Execution Report
Defect Report (Jira)
Final Test Summary Report

7. Entry & Exit Criteria
Entry Criteria
Code is deployed in SIT/UAT
Mock services are configured
Test data prepared
Exit Criteria
95% test cases executed
No P1/P2 defects open
All critical business workflows validated

8. Roles & Responsibilities
QA Manager ‚Üí Test Planning, Reporting
QA Lead ‚Üí Assign tasks, Review cases
QA Engineers ‚Üí Write & execute test cases, automation scripts
Dev Lead ‚Üí Support defect triage
Release Manager ‚Üí Approvals for deployment

9. Schedule / Milestones
Activity	Start Date	End Date	Owner
Test Plan Preparation	01-Sep-25	03-Sep-25	QA Lead
Test Case Design	04-Sep-25	10-Sep-25	QA Team
Test Environment Setup	08-Sep-25	09-Sep-25	DevOps
Test Execution (Sprint 1)	11-Sep-25	24-Sep-25	QA Team
Defect Fix & Retest	12-Sep-25	25-Sep-25	Dev + QA
Test Closure & Sign-off	26-Sep-25	27-Sep-25	QA Lead

10. Risks & Mitigation
Risk: Downstream services unstable in SIT ‚Üí Mitigation: Use Karate mocks.
Risk: Lack of test data ‚Üí Mitigation: Data seeding scripts.
Risk: Tight sprint timelines ‚Üí Mitigation: Prioritize smoke & high-priority cases.

11. Tools & Automation Scope
Automation Framework: Hybrid (Playwright + Karate + RestAssured)
CI/CD: Jenkins pipeline with USE_MOCK=true/false switch

Coverage Goal: 70% regression automation
üß† Sample Answer in an Interview:
‚ÄúWhenever we begin testing a new feature, 
we prepare a test plan that outlines the objective, scope, and test types. 
For example, when we delivered the new forex dashboard, I led the test planning. 
We included functional, regression, and API-level validation. Entry was set once code was deployed to SIT,
 and we exited after full regression passed and critical defects were closed. Risks like data unavailability 
were mitigated by mocking APIs. We tracked everything in JIRA and delivered a test report with sign-off to 
stakeholders.‚Äù

üîß Tools You Can Mention:
JIRA (for test cases/defects)
TestRail / XRay (for test planning)
Confluence (to store test plan doc)
Jenkins/GitHub Actions (CI integration)
