🔹 Step-by-Step Triage Flow
Acknowledge incident → Create Jira/ServiceNow ticket.
Assign Severity & Priority → S1P1 if production crash.
Spin up Incident Bridge → Slack/Zoom with Dev, QA, Ops, Product.
Mitigation first → Rollback, disable feature flag, apply workaround.
Root cause analysis → Logs, error monitoring, infra checks.
Hotfix deployment → QA validates fix in staging → deploy to PROD.
Verification → Smoke + regression tests + monitoring.
Post-mortem (PIR) → Identify gaps, update automation, improve alerts.

📝 Example Interview Soundbite

"In case of a production crash, I immediately classify it as Severity 1 / Priority 1 and initiate an incident 
bridge involving Dev, QA, Ops, and Product teams. While Devs analyze logs and potential rollback, QA validates 
the issue in a lower environment and prepares smoke tests for the fix. Once the hotfix is deployed, 
I verify critical flows and monitor production stability. Finally, we conduct a post-mortem to identify gaps
 in automation, monitoring, or release process to prevent recurrence."



Production Issue Strategy 

In one of our recent releases for the Transact platform at JPMorgan Chase, a production issue was reported within hours of deployment. 
The issue was related to the fund transfer functionality, which is a critical module in our retail banking operations. 
Certain user transactions were failing silently, and users did not receive confirmations or error messages.

✅ Task
As the Senior QA Engineer leading automation and shift-left efforts, my responsibility was to investigate the root cause, 
coordinate with developers to identify the fix, and most importantly, ensure such scenarios are covered in future test strategies and pipelines.

✅ Action
I followed a structured approach:
Issue Triage and RCA:
  Analyzed logs and payloads — discovered that special characters like <, &, and > in input fields were causing backend validation failures.
  These edge cases were not covered in our test data or automation scenarios.

Immediate Fix (with Dev Team):
   Deployed a hotfix where the backend added proper validation and frontend implemented character encoding.
   Communicated workaround to the support team for affected users.

Test Coverage Enhancement:
   Added negative test cases and edge case payloads into our RestAssured API automation suite using a data-driven approach with dynamic test data generation (Faker library).
   Implemented JSON schema validation in the CI pipeline to ensure API contracts are enforced for both request and response.

Process Improvement:
   Added a “real-world data test” checklist for every release.
   Integrated automation execution in nightly regression suites and added a PR-gate quality check with high-priority test cases.
   Initiated a shift-left QA review process where testers now review developer unit test cases and test data during story grooming.

✅ Result
We mitigated the issue within 4 hours of it being reported.
   Expanded our test coverage by 30%, especially for boundary and negative scenarios.
   Prevented similar issues in subsequent releases — no such production defects reported in the next 3 release cycles.
   Improved team collaboration across QA, Dev, and BA, and gained stakeholder trust by proactively addressing gaps.
