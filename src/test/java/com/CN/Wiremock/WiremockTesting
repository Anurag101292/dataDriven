Project made like there are configs ,services ,controller,client ,Interface

so in down strem we just need to provide our client and Interface

Services ---> where implementation,logic are written
controller where base url are written where the deployment goes
client --> where the besepath are written whic third party needed to hit


IN TDD approach we write the testcase just before the development starts , so how do we validate our testcase if
develoment not available so here we use mock services

Why we need mock services?
when the development services are not completed
when we dont have external services api in test environment.

TESTDOUBLE-->Also called as Stubs ,or dummy or mock

Fake as same as legacy system
Stubs  there is no logic in stub they are just clowns.
Mocks  Wiremock is a jvm based tools which acts as a httpbased API Simulator
It helps us create stubs and map bindings
it can also run as standalone server
we can also add maven dependencies to the project so that the stubs
are created through scripts
it helps us proxying and decoding

For manual testing download the wiremock jar
and to open java -jar wiremock.jar bydefault this start 8080
you can change also port

Mappings is a folder where we create Stubs

 Create STUB http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings
 or place a file with a .json extension under the mappings directory

 {
 "request":{
      "method":"GET",
      "url":"/some/thing"
      },
 "response":{
       "status":200,
       "body":"Hello world",
       "headers":{
       "content-type":"text/plain"
       }
     }
 }
