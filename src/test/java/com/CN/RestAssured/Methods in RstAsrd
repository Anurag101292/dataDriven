Those method which didnt update the resource at server end if the hit fails  is called SAFE.
IDEMPOTENT --> No matter how many times the http request hit it will not impact the intended
               effect on server.
Cacheable --> the server can cache the actual response not every hit you have to go on server
              and fetch the resources

GET= the method is used to fetch the data from the server and the data comes as a resource.

HEAD == it will transfer the headline and status code but not response payload benefits id to
                                          check the availabilty of api without hitting the get

POST is not idempotent

PUT == it can replace the resource if resource does not then it will create a new one, put is idempotent
200 if existed and replace
201 if new created
204 no content found

delete removes all kind of resource from target
patch will change the only part which you want to update
