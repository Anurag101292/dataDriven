AWS Pricing Calculator
----------------------
AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS.
You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, 
and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. 
This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set
of instances and services.
AWS Pricing Calculator can provide the estimate of the AWS service usage based on the list of AWS services.
AWS Cost Explorer -
-----------------
AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your
AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage 
associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view.
The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your
cost trends. 
AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.
AWS Budgets - 
------------
AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed 
(or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage 
targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly,
quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs
associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. 
AWS Budgets cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.

AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
--------------------------------
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is used to automatically distribute your incoming application traffic across all 
the EC2 instances that you are running. You can use Elastic Load Balancing to manage incoming requests by optimally 
routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed. Your load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all 
incoming web traffic to your application. When an instance is added, it needs to register with the load balancer or no 
traffic is routed to it.
When an instance is removed, it must deregister from the load balancer or traffic continues to be routed to it.

Amazon OpenSearch Service - 
-------------------------
Amazon OpenSearch Service makes it easy for you to perform interactive log analytics, 
real-time application monitoring, website search, and more. OpenSearch is an open source, 
distributed search and analytics suite derived from Elasticsearch.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk
----------------------
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and 
services developed in a variety of programming languages. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically
handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. 
You cannot use Beanstalk to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets.
